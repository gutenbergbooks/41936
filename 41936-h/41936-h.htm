<h2>PREFACE.</h2>


<p>It is now exactly twenty-five years since was published my
first book upon the large topics at present in hand. It was
but as a bow drawn at a venture, and was very properly entitled
"Elements of Political Economy." At that time I had
been teaching for about a dozen years in this Institution the
closely cognate subjects of History and Political Economy;
cognate indeed, since Hermann Lotze, a distinguished German
philosopher of our day, makes prominent among its only <i>five</i>
most general phases, the "industrial" element in all human
history; and since Goldwin Smith, an able English scholar,
resolves the elements of human progress, and thus of universal
history, into only <i>three</i>, namely, "the moral, the intellectual,
and the productive."</p>

<p>During these studious and observant years of teaching, I
had slowly come to a settled conviction that I could say something
of my own and something of consequence about Political
Economy, especially at two points; and these two proved in
the sequel to be more radical and transforming points than
was even thought of at the first. For one thing, I had satisfied
myself, that the word "Wealth," as at once a strangely
indefinite and grossly misleading term, was worse than useless
in the nomenclature of the Science, and would have to be
utterly dislodged from it, before a scientific content and defensible
form could by any possibility be given to what had
long been called in all the modern languages the "Science of
Wealth." Accordingly, so far as has appeared in the long
interval of time since 1865, these "Elements" were the very
first attempt to undertake an orderly construction of Economics
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
from beginning to end without once using or having occasion
to use the obnoxious word. A scientific substitute for
it was of course required, which, with the help of Bastiat, himself
however still clinging to the technical term "Richesse,"
was discerned and appropriated in the word "Value"; a good
word indeed, that can be simply and perfectly defined in a
scientific sense of its own; and, what is more important still,
that precisely covers in that sense all the three sorts of things
which are ever bought and sold, the three only Valuables in
short, namely, material Commodities, personal Services, commercial
Credits. It is of course involved in this simple-looking
but far-reaching change from "Wealth" to "Value," that Economics
become at once and throughout a science of Persons
buying and selling, and no longer as before a science of Things
howsoever manipulated for and in their market.</p>

<p>For another thing, before beginning to write out the first
word of that book, I believed myself to have made sure, by
repeated and multiform inductions, of this deepest truth in
the whole Science, which was a little after embodied (I hope I
may even say <i>embalmed</i>) in a phrase taking its proper place in
the book itself,&mdash;<i>A market for Products is products in Market</i>.
The fundamental thus tersely expressed may be formulated
more at length in this way: One cannot Sell without at the
same instant and in the same act Buying, nor Buy anything
without simultaneously Selling something else; because in
Buying one pays for what he buys, which is Selling, and in
Selling one must take pay for what is sold, which is Buying.
As these universal actions among men are always voluntary,
there must be also an universal motive leading up to them;
this motive on the part of both parties to each and every Sale
can be no other than the mutual satisfaction derivable to both;
the inference, accordingly, is easy and invincible, that governmental
restrictions on Sales, or prohibitions of them, must
lessen the satisfactions and retard the progress of mankind.</p>

<p>Organizing strictly all the matter of my book along these
two lines of Personality and Reciprocity, notwithstanding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
much in it that was crude and more that was redundant and
something that was ill-reasoned and unsound, the book made
on account of this original mode of treatment an immediate
impression upon the public, particularly upon teachers and
pupils; new streaks of light could not but be cast from these
new points of view, upon such topics especially as Land and
Money and Foreign Trade; and nothing is likely ever to rob
the author of the satisfaction, which he is willing to share
with the public, of having contributed something of importance
both in substance and in feature to the permanent up-building
of that Science, which comes closer, it may be, to the
homes and happiness and progress of the People, than any
other science. And let it be said in passing, that there is
one consideration well-fitted to stimulate and to reward each
patient and competent scientific inquirer, no matter what that
science may be in which he labors, namely, this: Any just
generalization, made and fortified inductively, is put thereby
beyond hazard of essential change for all time; for this best
of reasons, that God has constructed the World and Men on
everlasting lines of Order.</p>

<p>As successive editions of this first book were called for, and
as its many defects were brought out into the light through
teaching my own classes from it year after year, occasion was
taken to revise it and amend it and in large parts to rewrite it
again and again; until, in 1883, and for the eighteenth edition,
it was recast from bottom up for wholly new plates, and a
riper title was ventured upon,&mdash;"Political Economy,"&mdash;instead
of the original more tentative "Elements." Since then
have been weeded out the slight typographical and other minute
errors, and the book stands now in its ultimate shape.</p>

<p>My excellent publishers, who have always been keenly and
wisely alive to my interests as an author, suggested several
times after the success of the first book was reasonably assured,
that a second and smaller one should be written out, with an
especial eye to the needs of high schools and academies and
colleges for a text-book within moderate limits, yet soundly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
based and covering in full outline the whole subject. This is
the origin of the "Introduction to Political Economy," first
published in 1877, twelve years after the other. Its success
as a text-book and as a book of reading for young people has
already justified, and will doubtless continue to justify in the
future, the forethought of its promoters. It has found a place
in many popular libraries, and in courses of prescribed reading.
Twice it has been carefully corrected and somewhat enlarged,
and is now in its final form. In the preface to the later editions
of the "Introduction" may be found the following sentence,
which expresses a feeling not likely to undergo any
change in the time to come:&mdash;"I have long been, and am
still, ambitious that these books of mine may become the
horn-books of my countrymen in the study of this fascinating
Science."</p>

<p>Why, then, should I have undertaken of my own motion a
new and third book on Political Economy, and attempted to
mark the completion of the third cycle of a dozen years each
of teaching it, by offering to the public the present volume?
One reason is implied in the title, "<i>Principles of Political
Economy</i>." There are three extended historical chapters in
the earlier book, occupying more than one-quarter of its entire
space, which were indeed novel, which cost me wide research
and very great labor, and which have also proven useful and
largely illustrative of almost every phase of Economics; but
I wanted to leave behind me one book of about the same size
as that, devoted exclusively to the Principles of the Science,
and using History only incidentally to illustrate in passing
each topic as it came under review. For a college text-book
as this is designed to become, and for a book of reading and
reference for technical purposes, it seems better that all the
space should be taken up by purely scientific discussion and
illustration. This does not mean, however, that great pains
have not been taken in every part to make this book also
easily intelligible, and as readable and interesting as such
careful discussions can be made.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span></p>

<p>A second reason is, to provide for myself a fresh text-book
to teach from. My mind has become quite too thoroughly
familiarized with the other, even down to the very words, by
so long a course of instructing from it, for the best results in
the class-room. Accordingly, a new plan of construction has
been adopted. Instead of the fourteen chapters there, there
are but seven chapters here. Not a page nor a paragraph
as such has been copied from either of the preceding books.
Single sentences, and sometimes several of them together,
when they exactly fitted the purposes of the new context,
have been incorporated here and there, in what is throughout
both in form and style a new book, neither an enlargement
nor an abridgment nor a recasting of any other. I
anticipate great pleasure in the years immediately to come
from the handling with my classes, who have always been of
much assistance to me from the first in studying Political
Economy, a fresh book written expressly for them and for
others like-circumstanced; in which every principle is drawn
from the facts of every-day life by way of induction, and also
stands in vital touch with such facts (past or present) by way
of illustration.</p>

<p>The third and only other reason needful to be mentioned
here is, that in recent years the legislation of my country in
the matter of cheap Money and of artificial restrictions on
Trade has run so directly counter to sound Economics in
their very core, that I felt it a debt due to my countrymen
to use once more the best and ripest results of my life-long
studies, in the most cogent and persuasive way possible within
strictly scientific limits, to help them see and act for themselves
in the way of escape from false counsels and impoverishing
statutes. Wantonly and enormously heavy lies the
hand of the national Government upon the masses of the
people at present. But the People are sovereign, and not
their transient agents in the government; and the signs
are now cheering indeed, that they have not forgotten their
native word of command, nor that government is instituted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>
for the sole benefit of the governed and governing people,
nor that the greatest good of the greatest number is the true
aim and guide of Legislation. I am grateful for the proofs
that appear on every hand, that former labors in these directions
and under these motives have proven themselves to have
been both opportune and effective; and I am sanguine almost
to certainty, that this reiterated effort undertaken for the sake
of my fellow-citizens as a whole, will slowly bear abundant
fruit also, as towards their liberty of action as individuals,
and in their harmonious co-operation together as entire classes
to the end of popular comforts and universal progress.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I"></a>CHAPTER I.<br />

<small>VALUE.</small></h2>


<p>The first question that confronts the beginner in this
science, and the one also that controls the whole scope of
his inquiries to the very end, is: What is the precise subject
of Political Economy? Within what exact field do its
investigations lie? There is indeed a short and broad and
full answer at hand to this fundamental and comprehensive
question; and yet it is every way better for all concerned
to reach this answer by a route somewhat delayed and circuitous,
just as it is better in ascending a mountain summit
for the sake of a strong and complete view to circle up
leisurely on foot or on horseback, rather than to dash
straight up to the top by a cog-wheel railway and take
all of a sudden what might prove to be a less impressive
or a more confusing view.</p>

<p>The preliminary questions are: What sort of facts has
Political Economy to deal with, to inquire into, to classify,
to make a science of? Are these facts easily separable in
the mind and in reality from other kinds of facts perhaps
liable to be confounded with them? Are they facts of
vast importance to the welfare of mankind? And are the
activities of men everywhere greatly and increasingly
occupied with just those things, with which this science
has exclusively to do? Let us see if we cannot come little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
by little by a route of our own to clear and true answers
for all these questions.</p>

<p>If one should take his stand for an hour upon London
Bridge, perhaps the busiest bit of street in the world, and
cast his eyes around intelligently to see what he can see,
and begin also to classify the things coming under his
vision, what might he report to himself and to others?
Below the bridge in what is called the "Pool," which was
dredged out for that very purpose by the ancient Romans,
there lie at anchor or move coming and going many merchant-ships
of all nations, carrying out and bringing in to
an immense amount in the whole aggregate tangible articles
of all kinds to and from the remote as well as the near
nations of the earth. All this movement of visible goods,
home and foreign, is in the interest and under the impulse
of Buying and Selling. The foreign goods come in simply
to buy, that is, to pay for, the domestic goods taken away;
and these latter go out in effect even if not in appearance
to buy, that is, to pay for, the foreign goods coming in.
At the same hour the bridge itself is covered with land-vehicles
of every sort moving in both directions, loaded
with salable articles of every description; artisans of every
name are coming and going; merchants of many nationalities
step within the field of view; and porters and servants
and errand-boys are running to and fro, all in some
direct relation to the sale or purchase of those visible and
tangible things called in Political Economy <i>Commodities</i>.
Moreover, vast warehouses built in the sole interest of trade
on both sides the river above and below the bridge, built to
receive and to store for a time till their ultimate consumers
are found, some of these thousand things bought and sold
among men, lift their roofs towards heaven in plain sight.
Doubtless some few persons, like our observer himself, may
be on the spot for pleasure or instruction, but for the most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
part, all that he can see, the persons, the things, the buildings,
even the bridge itself, are where they are in the interest
of <i>Sales</i> of some sort, mostly of Commodities. What
is thus true of a single point in London is true in a degree
of every other part of London, of every part of Paris and
of Berlin, and in its measure of every other city and village
and hamlet in the whole world. Wherever there is a street
there is some exchange of commodities upon it, and wherever
there is a market there are buyers and sellers of
commodities.</p>

<p>If the curiosity of our supposed observer be whetted by
what he saw on London Bridge, and if the natural impulse
to generalize from particulars be deepened in his mind, he
may perhaps on his return to America take an opportunity
to see what he can see and learn what he can learn within
and around one of the mammoth cotton mills in Lowell or
Fall River or Cohoes. Should he take his stand for this
purpose at one of these points, say Lowell, he will be struck
at once by some of the differences between what he saw on
the bridge and what he now sees in the mill. He will
indeed see as before some commodities brought in and
carried out, such as the raw cotton and new machinery and
the finished product ready for sale, but in general no other
commodities than the cotton in its various stages of manufacture,
and those like the machinery and means of transportation
directly connected with transforming the cotton
into cloth and taking it to market.</p>

<p>But he sees a host of persons both within and without
the mill, all busy here and there, and all evidently bound
to the establishment by a strong unseen tie of some sort;
he sees varying degrees of authority and subordination
in these persons from the Treasurer, the apparent head
of the manufactory, down to the teamsters in the yard and
the common laborers within and without; he will not find
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
the owners of the property present in any capacity, for
they are scattered capitalists of Boston and elsewhere, who
have combined through an act of incorporation their distinct
capitals into a "Company" for manufacturing cotton;
besides their Treasurer present, whose act is their act
and whose contracts their contracts, he will see an Agent
also who acts under the Treasurer and directly upon the
Overseers and their assistants in the spinning and weaving
and coloring and finishing rooms, and under these Operatives
of every grade as skilled and unskilled; and lastly
he will observe, that the direct representatives of the owners
and all other persons present from highest to lowest
are conspiring with a will towards the common end of getting
the cotton cloth all made and marketed.</p>

<p>What is it that binds all these persons together? A little
tarrying in the Treasurer's office will answer this question
for our observer and for us. He will find it to be the
second kind of Buying and Selling. At stated times the
Treasurer pays the salary of the Agent, and his own. He
pays the wages of the Overseers and the wages of all the
Operatives and Laborers,&mdash;men and women and children.
Here he finds a buying and selling on a great scale not of
material commodities as before, but of personal services of
all the various kinds. Every man and woman and child
connected with the factory and doing its work sells an
intangible personal service to the "Company" and takes
his pay therefor, which last is a simple buying on the part
of the unseen employers. Here, then, in this mill is a single
specimen of this buying and selling of personal services,
which is going on to an immense extent and in every
possible direction in each civilized country of the world,
and everywhere to an immensely increased volume year by
year. Clergymen and lawyers and physicians and teachers
and legislators and judges and musicians and actors
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
and artisans of every name and laborers of every grade sell
their intangible services to Society, and take their pay
back at the market-rate. The aggregate value of all these
services sold in every advanced country is probably greater
than the aggregate value of the tangible commodities sold
there. At any rate, both classes alike, commodities and
services, are bought and sold under substantially the same
economic principles.</p>

<p>The inductive appetite in intelligent persons, that is to
say, their desire to classify facts and to generalize from
particulars, almost always grows by what it feeds on; and
our supposed observer will scarcely rest contented until he
has taken up at least one more stand-point, from which to
observe men's Buying and Selling. Suppose now he enter
for this purpose on any business-day morning the New
York Clearing-House. He will see about 125 persons
present, nearly one half of these bank clerks sitting behind
desks, and the other half standing before these desks or
moving in cue from one to the next. The room is perfectly
still. Not a word is spoken. The Manager of the
Clearing with his assistant sits or stands on a raised platform
at one end of the room, and gives the signal to begin
the Exchange. No commodities of any name or nature
are within the field of view. The manager indeed and his
assistant and two clerks of the establishment who sit near
him are in receipt of salaries for their personal services,
and all the other clerks present receive wages for their
services from their respective banks, but the exchange
about to commence is no sale of personal services any
more than it is a sale of tangible commodities. It is however
a striking instance of the buying and selling of some
valuables of the third and final class of valuable things.</p>

<p>At a given signal from the manager the (say) 60 bank
messengers, each standing in front of the desk of his own
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
bank and each having in hand before him 59 small parcels
of papers, the parcels arranged in the same definite order
as the desks around the room, step forward to the next
desk and deliver each his parcel to the clerk sitting behind
it, and so on till the circuit of the room is made. It takes
but ten minutes. Each parcel is made up of cheques or
credit-claims, the <i>property</i> of the bank that brings it and
the <i>debts</i> of the bank to which it is delivered. Accordingly
each bank of the circle receives through its sitting
clerk its own <i>debits</i> to all the rest of the banks, and delivers
to all through its standing messenger its own <i>credits</i> as
off-set. In other words, each bank buys of the rest what
it owes to each with what each owes to it. It is at bottom
a mutual buying and selling of debts. There is of course
a daily balance on one side or the other between every two
of these banks, which must be settled in money, because
it would never happen in practice that each should owe
the other precisely the same sum on any one day; but
substantially and almost exclusively the exchange at the
Clearing-House is a simple trade in credit-claims. Each
bank pays its debts by credits. A merchant is a dealer in
commodities, a laborer is a dealer in services, and a banker
is a dealer in credits. Each of the three is a buyer and
seller alike, and the difference is only in the kind of valuables
specially dealt in by each. In all cases alike, however,
there is no buying without selling and no selling
without buying; because, when one buys he must always
pay for what he buys and that is selling, and when one
sells he must always take his pay for what he sells and
that is buying. This is just as true when one credit is
bought or sold against a commodity or a service, and when
two or more credits are bought and sold as against each
other, as it is when two commodities or two services are
exchanged one for the other.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>But the Clearing-House is not by any means the only
place where credits or debts (they are the same thing) are
bought and sold. Every bank is such a place. Every
broker's office is such a place. Every place is an establishment
of the same kind where commercial rights, that
is, claims to be realized in future time and for which a
consideration is paid, are offered for sale and sold. The
amount of transactions in Credits in every commercial
country undoubtedly surpasses the amount in Commodities
or that in Services.</p>

<p>Now our supposed observer and classifier, having noted
on London Bridge the sale of material commodities, and in
the Lowell Mill the sale of personal services, and within
the New York Clearing-House the sale of credit-claims,
has seen in substance everything that ever was or ever
will be exhibited in the world of trade. He may rest.
There is no other class of salable things than these three.
Keen eyes and minds skilled in induction have been busy
for two millenniums and a half more or less to find another
class of things bought and sold among men, and have not
yet found it or any trace of it. This work has been perfectly
and scientifically done. The generalization is completed
for all time.</p>

<p>The <i>genus</i>, then, with which Political Economy deals
from beginning to end, has been discovered, can be described,
and is easily and completely separable for its own
purposes of science from all other kinds and classes and
<i>genera</i> of things, namely, Salable things or (what means
precisely the same) Valuable things or (what is exactly
equivalent) Exchangeable things. In other words, the sole
and single class of things, with which the Science of
Political Economy has to do, is Valuables, whose origin
and nature and extent and importance it is the purpose of
the present chapter to unfold. We have fully seen already
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
that this Genus, Valuables, is sub-divided into three
<i>species</i>, and three only, namely, Commodities, Services,
Credits. A little table here may help at once the eye and
the mind:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">
ECONOMICS.</p>

<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr>
<td class="tdl"><i>The Genus</i></td>
<td class="tdl">&nbsp;</td>
<td class="tdl"><i>Valuables</i></td></tr>
<tr>
<td class="tdl"><i>The Species</i></td>
<td class="tdl">{<br />{<br />{</td>
<td class="tdl"><i>Commodities</i><br /><i>Services</i><br /><i>Credits</i></td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>If only these three species of things are ever bought
and sold, then it certainly follows that only six kinds of
commercial exchanges are possible to be found in the
world, namely these:&mdash;</p>

<ul class="IX">
<li>1. <i>A commodity for a commodity.</i></li>
<li>2. <i>A commodity for a personal service.</i></li>
<li>3. <i>A commodity for a credit-claim.</i></li>
<li>4. <i>A personal service for another service.</i></li>
<li>5. <i>A personal service for a credit-claim.</i></li>
<li>6. <i>One credit-claim for another.</i></li>
</ul>

<p>Though the kinds of possible exchanges are thus very
few, the exchanges themselves in one or other of these six
forms and in all of them are innumerable on every business
day in every civilized country of the globe. And
this point is to be particularly noted, that while buying
and selling in these forms has been going on everywhere
since the dawn of authentic History, it has gone on all the
while in ever-increasing volume, it is increasing now more
rapidly and variously than ever, and moreover all signs
foretell that it will play a larger and still larger part in
the affairs of men and nations as this old world gains in
age and unity.</p>

<p>Damascus is one of the very oldest cities of the world,
and its very name means a "<i>seat of trade</i>." We are told
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
in the Scriptures, that Abraham about 2000 years before
Christ went up out of Egypt "very rich in cattle, in silver,
and in gold," and the only possible way he could have
acquired these possessions was by buying and selling. He
afterwards purchased the cave and the field in Hebron for
a family burial-place, and "weighed unto Ephron the silver
which he had named in the audience of the sons of Heth,
four hundred shekels of silver, current money with the
merchant." We may notice here, that there were then
"merchants" as a class, that silver by weight passed as
"money" from hand to hand, and that in the lack of
written deeds to land, as we have them, sales were "made
sure" before the faces of living men, who would tell the
truth and pass on the word. Abraham indeed seems to
have given the pitch for the song of trade sung by his
descendants, the Jews, from that day to this; for Jacob,
his grandson, was a skilled trafficker, not to say a secret
trickster, in his bargains; and wherever in the Old World
or the New the Jews have been, <i>there</i> have been in fact
and in fame busy buyers and sellers.</p>

<p>But the Jews have had no special privileges in the
realm of trade; on the contrary, they have always been
under special disabilities both legal and social. Even in
England, the most liberal country in Europe, they were
exiled for long periods, maltreated at all points of contact
with other people, more or less put under the ban of the
Common and the Statute law, often outrageously taxed on
their goods and persons, and studiously kept out of the
paths of highest public employment even down to a time
within the memory of living men.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
Yet so natural is the
impulse to trade, so universally diffused, so imperative
also if progress is in any direction to be attained, that the
English and all other peoples were as glad to borrow money,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
that is, buy the use of it, of the persecuted Jews, as the
latter were to get money by buying and selling other
things, and then to loan it, that is, sell the use of it, under
the best securities (never very good) for its return with
interest, that they could obtain. Happily, the mutual
gains that always wait on the Exchanges even when their
conditions are curtailed, of course attended the mutilated
exchanges between Jews and Christians: otherwise, they
would not continue to take place.</p>

<p>Christianity, however, as the perfected Judaism, gradually
brought in the better conditions, the higher impulses,
and the more certain rewards, of Trade, all which, we
may be sure, were designed in the divine Plan of the
world. What is called the Progress of Civilization has
been marked and conditioned at every step by an extension
of the opportunities, a greater facility in the use of
the means, a more eager searching for proper expedients,
and a higher certainty in the securing of the returns, of
mutual exchanges among men. There have been indeed,
and there still are, vast obstacles lying across the pathway
of this Progress in the unawakened desires and reluctant
industry and short-sighted selfishness of individuals, as
well as in the ignorant prejudices and mistaken legislation
of nations; but all the while Christianity has been indirectly
tugging away at these obstacles, and Civilization has
been able to rejoice over the partial or complete removal
of some of them; while also Christianity directly works
out in human character those chief qualities, on which the
highest success of commercial intercourse among men will
always depend, namely, Foresight, Diligence, Integrity,
and mutual Trust; so that, what we call Civilization is to
a large extent only the result of a better development of
these human qualities in domestic and foreign commerce.</p>

<p>Contrary to a common conception in the premises, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
sacred books of both Jews and Christians display no bias
at all against buying and selling, but rather extol such
action as praiseworthy, and also those qualities of mind
and habits of life that lead up to it and tend too to increase
its amount, and they constantly illustrate by means
of language derived from traffic the higher truths and more
spiritual life, which are the main object of these inspired
writers. It is indeed true that the chosen people of God
were forbidden to take Usury of each other, though they
were permitted to take it freely of strangers, and that
they were forbidden to buy horses and other products out
of Egypt, for fear they would be religiously corrupted by
such commercial intercourse with idolaters; but there is
nothing of this sort in the law of Moses that cannot be
easily explained from the grand purpose to found an agricultural
commonwealth for religious ends, in which commonwealth
no family could permanently alienate its land,
and in which it was a great object to preserve the independence
and equality of the tribes and families. Throughout
the Old Testament there is no word or precept that
implies that trade in itself is not helpful and wholesome;
there were sharp and effective provisions for the recovery
of debts; there were any number of exhortations to diligence
in business, such as, "<i>In the morning sow thy seed,
and at evening withhold not thy hand</i>"; King Solomon
himself made a gigantic exchange in preparation for the
temple with King Hiram of Tyre, by which the cedars of
Lebanon were to be paid for by the grain and oil of the
agricultural kingdom; chapter xxvii of the prophet Ezekiel
is a graphic description of the commerce of the ancient
world as it centered in the market of Tyre, a description
carried out into detail both as to the nations that frequented
that market and as to the products that were
exchanged in it,&mdash;"<i>silver, iron, tin, lead, persons of men,</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
<i>vessels of brass, horses, horsemen, mules, horns of ivory,
ebony-wood, carbuncles, purple work, fine linen, corals, rubies,
wheat, pastry, syrup, oil, balm, wine of Helbon, white wool,
thread, wrought iron, cassia, sweet reed, cloth, lambs, rams,
goats, precious spices, precious stones, splendid apparel, mantles
of blue, embroidered work, chests of damask, and gold</i>";
and chapter xxxi of Proverbs describes the model housewife
in terms like these,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>The heart of her husband trusteth in her,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>And he is in no want of gain.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>She seeketh wool and flax,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>And worketh willingly with her hands.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>She is like the merchants' ships;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>She bringeth her food from afar.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>She riseth while it is yet night,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>And giveth food to her family,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>And a task to her maidens.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>She layeth a plan for a field and buyeth it;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>With the fruit of her hands she planteth a vineyard.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>She perceiveth how pleasant is her gain,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>And her lamp is not extinguished in the night.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>She putteth forth her hands to the distaff,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>And her hands take hold of the spindle.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>She maketh for herself coverlets;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Her clothing is of fine linen and purple.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>She maketh linen garments and selleth them,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>And delivereth girdles to the merchants.</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Still more explicit and instructive are the words and
spirit of the New Testament. There cannot be the least
doubt that the whole influence of Christianity is favorable
to the freest commercial exchanges at home and abroad,
because these depend largely on mutual confidence between
man and man, of which confidence Christianity is the
greatest promoter. It may be conceded at once that our
Lord "<i>overthrew the tables of the money-changers and the
seats of them that sold doves</i>" within the sacred precincts
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
of the temple, but this, not because it is wrong to change
money or sell doves, but because that was not the <i>place</i>
for such merchandising; so He himself explained his own
action in the sequel; provincial worshippers coming up to
Jerusalem must needs have their coins changed into the
money of the Capital, and must needs buy somewhere the
animal victims for sacrifice; but the whip of small cords
had significance only as to the <i>place</i>, and not at all as to
the <i>propriety</i>, of such trading.</p>

<p>One of our Lord's parables, the parable of the Talents,
sets forth in several striking lights the privilege and duty
and reward of diligent trading. "<i>Then he that had received
the five talents went and traded with the same, and
made them other five talents.</i>" And when this servant came
to the reckoning, and brought as the result of his free and
busy traffic "<i>five talents more</i>," the prompt and hearty
approval of his lord&mdash;"well done, thou good and faithful
servant"&mdash;becomes the testimony of the New Testament
to the merit and the profit and the benefit of a vigorous
buying and selling. For this servant could not have been
authoritatively pronounced good and faithful if the results
of his action commended had been in any way prejudicial
to others. The truth is, as we shall abundantly see by and
by with the reasons of it, that any man who buys and sells
under the free and natural conditions of trade, benefits the
man he trades with just as much as he benefits himself.
But the parable has a still stronger word in favor of
exchanges. There was another servant also entrusted
with capital by his lord at the same time, when the latter
was about to travel "<i>into a far country</i>." We are expressly
told that distribution was made "<i>to every man according to
his several ability</i>," and thus this servant was only entrusted
with a single talent, the size of the capital given to him
being in just proportion to the size of the man,&mdash;the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
smallest share falling of course to the smallest man. But
he had the same opportunity as the two others. The world
was open to him. Capital was in demand, if not in those
parts then in some other, to which, like his lord, he might
straightway take his journey. But when his time of reckoning
came, and he had nothing to show for the use of his
capital, he upbraided his lord as a hard man for expecting
any increase, and brought out his bare talent wrapped in
a napkin, saying, "<i>I was afraid, and I went and hid thy talent
in the earth</i>." His wise lord at once denounced this
servant as "<i>wicked and slothful</i>," insisted that his money
ought to have been "<i>put to the exchangers</i>," and said finally
in a just anger "<i>cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer
darkness</i>."</p>

<p>It is moreover in incidental passages of the Scriptures,
in which the methods of business are commended to the
searchers after higher things, that we see their high estimate
of those methods and gains. "<i>Buy the truth, and sell
it not; buy wisdom and understanding</i>" (Prov. xxiii, 23).
"<i>Buying up for yourselves opportunities</i>" (Col. iv, 5). "<i>I
counsel thee to buy of me gold refined by fire, that thou mayest
be rich; and white garments, that thou mayest be clothed;
and eye-salve to anoint thine eyes, that thou mayest see</i>"
(Rev. iii, 18). "<i>But rather let him labor, working with his
hands at that which is good, that he may have to give to him
that is in need</i>" (Eph. iv, 28). "<i>But if any one provideth
not for his own, and especially for those of his own house,
he hath denied the faith, and is worse than an unbeliever</i>"
(1 Tim. v, 8).</p>

<p>Now, the universal test and proof of any truth is its
harmony with some other truths. Does an alleged truth
fall in with and fill out well some other demonstrated and
accepted proposition, or a number of such other propositions?
If so, then that truth is <i>proved</i>. Human reason
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
can no further go. The mind rests with relish and content
in a new acquisition. To apply this to the case in hand,&mdash;if
men were designed of their Maker to buy and sell to
their own mutual benefit and advancement, if mankind
have always been buying and selling as towards that end
and with that obvious result, and if the Future promises to
increase and reduplicate the buying and selling of the
Present in every direction without end, and all in the
interest of a broad civilization and a true and lasting
progress; and if, in harmony with these truths, the written
revelation of God in every part of it assumes that buying
and selling in its inmost substance and essential forms be
good and righteous and progressive, and suitable in all its
ends and methods to illustrate and enforce ends and methods
in the higher kingdom of spiritual and eternal Life;&mdash;then
these coördinate truths will logically and certainly
follow, (1) that Trade is natural and essential and beneficial
to mankind; (2) that it constitutes in an important
sense a realm of human thought and action by itself, separate
from the neighboring realm of Giving, and equally
from the hostile realm of Stealing; and (3) that a careful
analysis of what buying and selling in its own peculiar
nature is, a thorough ascertainment and a consequent
clear statement of its fundamental laws, and a faithful
exposure of what in individual selfishness and in subtle or
open Legislation makes against these laws, <i>must be of large
consequence to the welfare of mankind</i>.</p>

<p>Accordingly, let us now attempt such Analysis and
Ascertainment and Exposure. This is precisely the task
that lies before us in this book&mdash;just this, and nothing
more. The term, "Political Economy," has long been and
is still an elastic title over the zealous work of many men
in many lands; but in the hands of the present writer
during a life now no longer short, the term has always had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
a definite meaning, the work has covered an easily circumscribed
field, and so the present undertaking concerns only
Buying and Selling and what is essentially involved in
that. This gives scope and verge enough for the studies
of a life-time. This has the advantage of a complete
sphere of its own. Terms may thus be made as definite as
the nature of language will ever allow; definitions will
thus cover things of one kind only; and generalizations,
although they may be delicate and difficult, will deal with
no incongruous and obstinate material.</p>

<p>1. The grandfather of the writer, an illiterate but long-headed
farmer, was able to give good points to his three
college-bred sons, by insisting that they look "<i>into the
natur on't</i>." What, then, are the ultimate elements of
Buying and Selling? What are the invariable conditions
that precede, accompany, and follow, any and every act of
Trade? Of course we are investigating now and throughout
this treatise the deliberative acts of reasonably intelligent
human beings, in one great department of their
common foresight and rational action. We have consequently
nothing to do here with Fraud or Theft or Mania or
Gift. Acts put forth under the impulse of these are direct
opposites of, or at best antagonistic to, acts of Trade.
They tend to kill trade, and therefore they are no part of
trade. These, then, and such as these, aside, we will now
analyze a single Act of Exchange at one time and place,&mdash;which
will serve in substance for all acts of exchange in
all times and places, and just find out for ourselves what
are the Fundamentals and Essentials of that matter, with
which alone we have to do in this science of Political
Economy.</p>

<p>Incidental reference was had a little way back to an
Exchange once made between King Solomon of Jerusalem
and King Hiram of Tyre. Let that be our typical instance.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
(a) <i>There were two persons</i>, Solomon and Hiram.
Those two, and no more, stood face to face, as it were, to
make a commercial bargain. They made it, and it was
afterwards executed. The execution indeed concerned a
great many persons on both sides, and occupied a long
period of time; but the bargain itself, the trade, the exchange,
the covenant, concerned only two persons, and
occupied but a moment of time. It made no difference
with the bargain as such, with the binding nature of it,
with the terms of it, with the mutual gains of it, that each
person represented a host of others, subordinates and subjects,
who would have to coöperate in the carrying of it
out, because each king had the right to speak for his subjects
as well as for himself, for commercial purposes each
was an agent as well as a monarch, the word of each concluded
the consent and the action of others as well as his
own. Nor did it make any, the least, difference with this
exchange or the advantages of it, that each party to it
belonged to, was even the head of, independent and sometimes
hostile Peoples. Commerce is one thing, and nationality
a totally different thing. The present point is, in the
words of the old proverb,&mdash;"It takes two to make a bargain."
And it takes <i>only</i> two to make a bargain. When
corporations and even nations speak in trade, they speak,
and speak finally, through one accredited agent. We
reach, then, as the first bit of our analysis of Trade, the
fact, that there are always two parties to it, "the party of
the first part and the party of the second part."</p>

<p>(b) <i>There were two desires</i>, Solomon's desire for cedar-timbers
to build the temple with, and Hiram's desire for
wheat and oil with which to support the people of his sterile
kingdom. "<i>So Hiram gave Solomon cedar-trees and fir-trees
according to all his desire: and Solomon gave Hiram
twenty thousand measures of wheat for food to his household,</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
<i>and twenty measures of pure oil.</i>" The desire of each party
was personal and peculiar, known at first only to himself,
but upon occasion became directed towards something in
the possession of the other, and each at length became
aware of the desire of the other, and also of his own ability
to satisfy the want of the other. If Solomon could
have satisfied his desire for timber by his own or his subjects'
efforts directly, this trade would never have taken
place; if Hiram or his subjects could have gotten the
wheat and oil directly out of their narrow and sandy strips
of sea-coast, this trade would not have taken place; and
so there must be in every case of trade not only two desires
each springing from a separate person, but also each
person must have in his possession something fitted to
gratify the desire of the other person, and each be willing
to yield that something into the possession of the other for
the sake of receiving from him that which will satisfy his
own desire, and so both desires be satisfied indirectly.</p>

<p>Here is the deep and perennial source of exchanges.
Men's desires are so many and various, and so constantly
becoming more numerous and miscellaneous, and so extremely
few of his own wants can ever be met by any one
man directly, that the foundation of exchanges, and of a
perpetually increasing volume of exchanges, is laid in the
deep places of human hearts, namely, in Desires ever welling
up to the surface and demanding their satisfaction
through an easy and natural interaction with the ever
swelling Desires of other men. Here too is a firm foundation
(a chief foundation) of human Society. Reciprocal
wants, which can only be met through exchanges, draw men
together locally and bind them together socially, in hamlets
and towns and cities and States and Nations, and also knit
ties scarcely less strong and beneficent between the separate
and remotest nationalities of the earth. It is certain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
that an inland commercial route connected the East of
Asia with the West of Europe centuries before Christ, and
that a traffic was maintained on the frontier of China between
the Sina and the Scythians, in the manner still followed
by the Chinese and the Russians at <i>Kiachta</i>. The
Sina had an independent position in Western China as
early as the eighth century before Christ, and five centuries
later established their sway under the dynasty of Tsin
(whence our word "China") over the whole of the empire.
The prophet Isaiah exclaims (xlix, 12), "Behold! these
shall come from far; and behold! these from the North
and from the West; <i>and these from the land of Sinim</i>."
The second bit of our analysis leads to Desires as an
essential and fundamental element in every commercial
transaction.</p>

<p>(c) <i>There were two efforts</i>, those of the Tyrians as represented
by King Hiram and those of the Israelites as represented
by King Solomon. It was no holiday task that
was implied in the proposition of Solomon to the party of
the other part,&mdash;"<i>Send me now cedar-trees, fir-trees, and
algum-trees out of Lebanon; for I know that thy servants
are skilful to cut timber in Lebanon; even to prepare me
timber in abundance, for the house which I am about to build
shall be wonderfully great.</i>" On the other hand, the efforts
insolved on the part of the people of Israel in paying for
these timbers, and for their transportation by sea from
Lebanon to Joppa, were equally gigantic. Solomon's offer
in return for the proposed service of the Tyrian king was
in these words,&mdash;"<i>And behold, I will give to thy servants,
the hewers that cut timber, twenty thousand measures of
beaten wheat, and twenty thousand measures of barley, and
twenty thousand baths of wine, and twenty thousand baths
of oil.</i>"</p>

<p>The reason why two efforts are always an element in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
every act of traffic, however small or however large the
transaction may be, is the obvious reason, that the things
rendered in exchange, whether they be Commodities, Services,
or Credits, invariably cost efforts of some kind to
get them ready to sell and to sell them, and no person can
have a just claim to render them in exchange, who has not
either put forth these efforts himself or become proprietor
in some way of the result of such efforts. Efforts accordingly
are central in all trade. Every trade in its inmost
nature is and must be either an exchange of two Efforts
directly, as when one of two farmers personally helps his
neighbor in haying for the sake of securing that neighbor's
personal help in his own harvesting, or an exchange of two
things each of which is the result of previous Efforts of
somebody, as when a man gives a silver dollar for a bushel
of wheat. The third bit of the present analysis brings us
to Efforts, perhaps the most important factor in the whole
list.</p>

<p>(d) <i>There were also two reciprocal estimates</i>, the estimate
of King Hiram of all the efforts requisite to cut and
hew and float the timber, as compared with the aggregate
of efforts needed to obtain the necessary wheat and barley
and wine and oil in any other possible way; and the estimate
of King Solomon of all the labors required to grow
and market these agricultural products, as compared with
what would otherwise be involved in getting the much-wished-for
timbers. Such estimates invariably precede
every rational exchange of products. It is not in human
nature to render a greater effort or the result of it, when a
lesser effort or the result of it will as well procure the satisfaction
of a desire. Efforts are naturally irksome. No
more of them will ever be put forth than is necessary to
meet the want that calls them forth. No man in his senses
will ever put more labor on anything, with which to buy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
something else, than is necessary to get that something
else by direct effort or through some other exchange.
Here we are on ground as solid as the very substance of
truth can make it. The Jews of Solomon's time were too
shrewd and sparing of irksome labor to devote themselves
for years to the toils of the field and of the vat to get by
traffic the materials for their temple, if they could have
gotten those materials by a less expenditure of toil in any
other way. Those Ph&oelig;nicians of Tyre and Sidon, the born
merchants of the East, the founders of commercial Carthage
in the West, if they could have extorted from the
reluctant sands of their coast the cereals and the vines and
olives requisite for their own support with only so much
of exertion as was needed to get that to market with which
to buy them, would never have taken the indirect in preference
to the direct method. They took the indirect,
because it was the easier, and therefore the better.</p>

<p>It may, accordingly, be laid down as a maxim, that men
never buy and sell to satisfy their wants but when that is
the easiest and best way to satisfy them. It saves effort.
It saves time. It saves trouble. It divides labor. It induces
skill. It propels progress. But in order to determine
which may be the easier way, requires constant
<i>estimates</i> on the part of each party to a possible trade.
Shall I shave myself or go to the barber? Before I decide,
I estimate the direct effort in the light of the effort to get
that with which to pay the barber for his service. If I
trade with him, it is because I deem it easier, cheaper in
effort, more convenient in time. Trade means comparisons
in every case&mdash;comparisons by both parties&mdash;and in the
more recondite and complicated cases, elaborate comparisons
and often comprehensive calculations involving
future time.</p>

<p>Now these estimates inseparable from exchanges, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
these calculations which are a factor in all the far-reaching
exchanges, are mental activities. They quicken and
strengthen the <i>minds</i> of men. Trade is usually, if not
always, the initial step in the mental development of individuals
and nations. Desires stir early in the minds of all
children; efforts more or less earnest are the speedy outcome
of natural desires; direct efforts, however, to satisfy
these soon reach their limits; it is now but a step over to
simple exchanges, by which the desires are met indirectly;
exchanges once commenced tend to multiply in all directions,
and the estimates that must precede and accompany
these are mental states,&mdash;the more of them, the greater
the mental development, the higher the education; consequently,
commerce domestic and foreign is a grand agency
in civilization, a constant and broadening impulse towards
progress in all its forms; and Christianity, as we have
already seen, is friendly to commerce in its every breath.
Those, therefore, who talk and preach about Trade as tending
to <i>materialism</i>, do not know what they are talking
about. Because Commodities are material things, and
because a portion of the trade of the world concerns itself
with commodities, these shallow thinkers jump to the conclusion
that trade is materialistic. <i>It is just the reverse.</i>
Let us hear no more from Professor Pulpit or Platform
that buying and selling is antagonistic to men's higher
intellectual and spiritual culture, because the present careful
analysis has brought us indubitably to mental Estimates
and prolonged comparisons, which are activities of
Mind, as the fourth and a leading factor among the radical
elements of Sale.</p>

<p>(e) <i>There were two renderings</i>, King Hiram's rendering
at Joppa the desired cedars from the mountains of Lebanon,
and King Solomon's rendering in return at Tyre the
food products grown in his fertile country. These renderings
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
were visible to all men. Unlike the desires and the
estimates, which were subjective and invisible; the actual
exchange of the products, the culmination of the previous
efforts, the stipulated renderings by and to each party, were
outward and objective&mdash;"known and read of all men."
This is the reason why public attention is always strongly
drawn to this particular link of the chain of events which
we are now unlocking and taking apart, while other links
of the series, that are just as essential, almost wholly escape
observation. The ports and the markets are apt to be
noisy and conspicuous, when the desires and the estimates
and the satisfactions, without which in their place there
would be no market-places, work in silence, and leave
no records except the indirect one of the renderings
themselves.</p>

<p>It is of great moment to note here, that each of the two
parties to an exchange always has an advantage over the
other, either absolute or relative, in the rendering his own
product, whatever it may be, as compared with his present
ability to get directly or through any other exchange the
product he receives in return. Take the example in hand.
Cedars and sandal-wood were natural to Mount Lebanon;
there were no other workmen in those regions of country
that could "<i>skill to hew timber like unto the Sidonians</i>";
the Mediterranean afforded a level and free and easy highway
from its northern coast to the Judean seaport at
Joppa; and all these natural and acquired facilities put
King Hiram into a posture of advantage in the rendering
of timber, not only over the Jews, but also over all the
other peoples in the basin of the midland sea. Still this
advantage, great as it was, could only be made a real and
palpable gain to themselves, the proprietors of the timber,
by means of some exchange with somebody else, by which
some wants of their own greater than their present want
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
of timber, could be supplied by means of the timber.
They had more of that commodity, and more skill to fashion
and transport it, than their present and immediately
prospective needs could make use of; and the only way
in which they could practically avail themselves of their
advantages, was, to sell their surplus timber and buy with
it something that they needed more. Otherwise their very
advantage perished with them. God has scattered such
a diversity of blessings and capacities and opportunities
over the earth on purpose, that, through traffic, on which
his special benediction rests, the good of each part and
people may become the portion of other parts and peoples.</p>

<p>So, on the other hand, of the southern neighbors of the
Tyrians. There the earth brought forth by handfuls.
There was an abundance of corn in the land, even to the
tops of the mountains. Its fruit did indeed shake like
Lebanon. But there were no cedars there, no fir-trees, no
sandal-woods. How short-sighted, then, and futile, would
it have been for the Jews, to try to hang on in their own
behoof to all the natural advantages that God had given
to them, and to say, We will not part with the direct results
of any of them, we will build treasure-cities as they
did in Egypt, we will store up all the fruits of these fat
years against the possible coming of some famine years in
the time to come. That is anything in ordinary times but
the divine plan. It is anything but the letter and spirit
of the divine injunction: "<i>Him that keepeth back corn the
people curse; but blessing shall be upon the head of him that
selleth it</i>" (Prov. xii, 26). Had they talked and acted
thus, no temple could then have been built in Jerusalem,
and the people of that generation would have lost the
moral and religious impulse and uplifting of their service
and sacrifice. Their grain would have become worthless
from its very abundance, and would have decayed on their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
hands. They would have missed a great gain for themselves,
and would have snatched away from their neighbors
to the northward a providential opportunity for an
equal gain.</p>

<p>The general truth must not be lost sight of here, even
in passing, that all trade whatsoever is based upon a
Diversity of relative Advantage as between the parties
exchanging products. If, for example, the Hills of Judah
and the Mountains of Israel had been covered with timber
suitable for building the temple, and the coasts of Tyre
and Sidon and the foot-hills of Lebanon had been fertile
stretches of arable land, this particular trade would never
have been thought of and could never have been realized.
There would have been no gain in it for either party, and
unless there be a valid gain for both parties at least in
prospect, no trade will ever spring into being, because
there would be no motive, no impulse, no reason, in it.
Unless the Jews could get the timber easier by raising
grain to pay for it, and the Tyrians get the oil and wheat
and barley easier by cutting and floating timber to pay for
them,&mdash;no trade; but the greater easiness to each actually
came about, because each had an Advantage both natural
and acquired over the other in his own rendering, and the
mutual gain of the trade was wholly owing to that circumstance.
So far as that matter went, the Tyrians had no
cause to envy their neighbors the superior soil of the
south, for they reaped indirectly but effectively a part of
those harvests for themselves; and the Jews had no reason
to be jealous of their northern neighbors on account of the
noble forests crowning their mountains, because through
trade they secured easily to themselves a share of that vast
natural advantage. Diversity of Advantage both natural
and acquired is the sole ground of Trade both domestic
and foreign; and consequently by means of trade the
peculiar advantages of each are fully shared in by all.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>It is perhaps less obvious but surely equally true, that
the greater the relative diversity of advantage as between
two exchangers, the more profitable does the exchange
become to each. If the Vale of Sharon had been twice
as fertile as it was, and the cedars of Lebanon twice as
large and lofty as they were, the easier and better would
Israel have gotten its timber, and the more secure and
abundant would have become the food of Tyre and Sidon;
and, therefore, the more unreasonable, or rather the more
absurd and wicked, would have been any envy or jealousy
of either of the superior advantages at any point or points
of the other. So universally. By the divine Purpose as
expressed in the constitution of Nature, in the structure
of Man, and in the laws of Society, Trade in good measure
and degree imparts to each the bounties of all, arms each
with the power of all, and impels each by the progress of
all.</p>

<p>One other important matter is closely connected with
these two Renderings, which is the fifth bit in succession
of our present analysis, namely this, that traffic renderings
always make necessary new and better routes of travel
and transportation. It is mainly for this reason, that persons
and things have to be carried to distances less or
greater in order to consummate these Renderings of home
and foreign commerce, that roads by land and routes by sea
have been sought for and found, made and made shorter,
improved as to method and facilitated as to force, from the
dawn of History until the present hour. It was to get
the goods of India, and so find a market for the goods
of Europe, that the earliest land routes between the two
were tried and maintained. The ground-thought of
Columbus, meditated on for years, was to discover a new
commercial way to India; Magellan with the same intent
sailed westward through the Straits that wear his name,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
and so circumnavigated the globe; repeated searches
mainly with the mercantile view, never long intermitted,
have attempted ever since the North-West or the North-East
passage to India; Vasco da Gama in 1497 boldly
accomplished the East passage, and thus changed for all
the Continents the channels of trade; the West now trades
with all the East through the Suez Canal, dug for that
express purpose; and the words, "Panama" and "Nicaragua"
are upon everybody's lips, simply because through
Central America is the shortest and safest route for men
and goods to and from all the Oceans.</p>

<p>Quite recently Dr. W. Heyd has announced through the
Berlin Geographical Society the discovery of two commercial
routes from India to the West not hitherto described.
Trebizond (on the Black Sea) and Tana (at the mouth of
the Don) were the chief distributing points. Through
Tana passed westward the pepper and ginger and nutmeg
and cloves; and the price of spices is said to have doubled
in Italy, when the Italians were for a time shut out of
Tana in 1343. The chief overland route from India to
Tana ran through Cabul to Khiva by the Oxus, and then
by land through Astrakhan. The other route to Trebizond
passed through Persia, and came out by Tabriz to the
Black Sea. It may perhaps be pardoned, if a far homelier,
more modern, and even local, illustration be given of the
present point, that trade makes roads. The western wall
of Williamstown is the mountain range of the Taconics,
whose general height is about 2000 feet above tide water
at Albany. Within the limits of this town are four natural
depressions or passes over this range, which is also the
watershed between the Hoosac River on the east and the
Little Hoosac on the west. About the beginning of this
century, the population was quite sparse in both these valleys,
while the impulse to travel and traffic over the barrier
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
was sufficient to build (wholly at local expense) wagon
roads over each of the four passes, one of which soon after
became a turnpike between Northampton and Albany;
and another was built mainly to accommodate the medical
practice on the west side of the mountain of Dr. Samuel
Porter&mdash;a Williamstown surgeon of local eminence. So
soon as railroads were constructed to run down these parallel
valleys (railroads themselves are perhaps the best
illustration of the point in hand), the mountain roads were
relatively deserted, and only two of them are now open to
transient travel.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>Lastly, (f) <i>There were two satisfactions</i>, the satisfaction
of the southern king in actually obtaining the excellent
timbers, without which the cherished national temple could
not have gone up; and the satisfaction by the northern
king in the easy receiving of the abundant food products
for the daily maintenance of his court and kingdom. The
simple story of these commercial transactions between Jew
and Tyrian indicates clearly enough, what might have
been anticipated and what always happens in such circumstances,
not only a mutual satisfaction at the completion
of each specific exchange, but also a general relation of
contentment and peace in consequence of advantageous
commercial intercourse. "<i>And Hiram, king of Tyre, sent
his servants unto Solomon; for he had heard, that they had
anointed him king in the room of his father; because Hiram
was ever a lover of David. And it came to pass, when Hiram
heard the words of Solomon, that he rejoiced greatly, and
said, Blessed be the Lord this day, which hath given unto
David a wise son over this great people; and there was peace
between Hiram and Solomon; and they two made a league
together.</i>"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>
<p>It is plain to reason and to all experience, that mutual
Satisfactions are the ultimate thing in exchanges. Our
present analysis can go no further, for the reason, that we
have now reached in Satisfactions the end, for the sake of
which all the previous processes have been gone through
with. Persons do not engage in buying and selling for
the mere pleasure of it, but always for the sake of some
satisfactions derivable to both parties from the issue of it.
Ordinary self-inspection and foresight and industry being
presupposed, the issue of exchanges is just what was expected
by the two persons, the satisfaction of each follows
as a matter of course, and stimulates to new exchanges in
ever-widening circles.</p>

<p>Since the desires of all men, which the efforts of other
men can satisfy through exchange, are indefinite in number
and unlimited in degree, there is no end of human
Satisfactions to be reached along this road of reciprocal
trade; and since the very object of all trade and the actual
result of all trade (the exceptions are infinitesimal) is to
multiply and reduplicate continually mutual Satisfactions
among men; we can see right here what a loss and wrong
it is, what a wanton destruction of possible human happiness
it is, what a bar to progress among men in comforts
and powers it is, for nations to impede and to prohibit
commerce by legislation! As we shall see more fully in a
later chapter, Governments can have no moral or constitutional
right to restrict the trade of their people, except in
the sole interest of revenue or health or morals.</p>

<p>Such is the constitution of the universe, that a really
good thing is usually cognate with and inseparable from
a good many other good things. Buying and selling, as
we have now clearly seen, springs right out of the nature
of men in the circumstances in which they are providentially
placed on the earth, and ends in the satisfaction of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
innumerable wants common to all men. This makes trade
a thoroughly good thing in itself; and consequently it is
intimately associated with many other good things. The
scriptural instance, that we have been examining, gives a
neat illustration of this: "<i>and there was peace between
Hiram and Solomon; and they two made a league together</i>."
The mutually profitable exchange of commodities led to a
feeling of amity between the two neighboring kings; the
feeling of amity led to a treaty of Peace between the two
adjacent nations; and the "<i>league</i>" so ratified not only kept
out war from their borders, but also permitted the unhindered
continuance of profitable exchanges between them.</p>

<p>So it is always. Peace waits on Commerce. Good-will
among the nations is strengthened by the ties of interest
and profit among their citizens. The mercantile classes as
such are always averse to war, because war is the natural
enemy of exchanges. Thus traffic leads to peace and tends
to maintain it, and peace preludes increased prosperity, and
commercial prosperity under freedom is wholly friendly to
mental and moral progress, and Christianity walks before
and all along this line of individual and national blessing.
The commercial treaty of 1860 between France and England
has tended powerfully, perhaps more powerfully than
any other single cause, to keep those formerly inter-belligerent
nationalities in peace and amity ever since.</p>

<p>We will now put into a little table the final results of
the present analysis of Buying and Selling. The ultimate
elements seem to be these:</p>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr>
<td class="tdl" width="50%">1. <i>Two Persons.</i></td>
<td class="tdl" width="50%">4. <i>Two Estimates.</i></td></tr>
<tr>
<td class="tdl">2. <i>Two Desires.</i></td>
<td class="tdl">5. <i>Two Renderings.</i></td></tr>
<tr>
<td class="tdl">3. <i>Two Efforts.</i></td>
<td class="tdl">6. <i>Two Satisfactions.</i></td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>The thoughtful reader will note in this table the fact,
that three of these elements are objective, that is, outward
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
and visible; and the other three are subjective, that is,
inward and invisible. Persons, Efforts, Renderings, are
seen and known of all men; Desires, Estimates, Satisfactions,
can be directly known only to the persons who feel
and make them. This is a peculiarity of Political Economy,
that has been far too little observed even when it has been
observed at all. Objective and subjective elements in it
meet and mingle in each transaction. Indeed, they alternate,
as is shown in the table above: first a Seen, and then
an Unseen, Element throughout. It is this commingling
of outward and inward, visible and invisible, that makes
all the difficulty and gives all the fascination in Political
Economy. Whatever carries us into the steady though
billowy play of universal human nature is at once difficult
and fascinating.</p>

<p>Quite contrary, however, to a common impression, the
<i>certainty</i> both of action and prediction in all the other Sciences
as well as in Economics lies rather in the unseen elements
than in those that are seen. Take for an example the
calculation of an eclipse: it is not so much from what is
visible in the heavens and on the earth that the astronomer
infers and predicts to the instant the shadow of one
orb thrown upon another, as it is from the wholly hidden
but ever-enduring forces of gravitation constantly relating
these orbs one to the other. So it is of the Sciences
generally; progress is made in them and certainties are
reached in connection with them, "<i>while we look not at the
things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen;
for the things which are seen are but for a time; but the
things which are not seen are everlasting</i>." Invisible Desires
and Satisfactions felt in connection with Exchanges
are among the most constant elements of human nature;
they, as it were, give birth to the relatively more transient
(though visible) data of Efforts and Renderings; while
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
inferences and conclusions and even predictions may be
securely drawn from all of these, giving a solid ground for
Political Economy to stand on,&mdash;almost as solid as the
ground of the chief Physical Sciences.</p>

<p>2. We will next examine the inmost nature and the outward
manifestations of <i>Value</i>. "Value" is by much the
most important word in the Science of Economics; and we
must, therefore, comprehend it thoroughly, root and branch.
Nearly all the writers in English have used in place of
this the word "Wealth" and those in other languages
some equivalent and equally concrete word; but the present
writer fully satisfied himself some twenty-five years
ago, that it is impossible to use that word to any advantage
in economical discussions, owing to its inherent
ambiguities and concrete associations in the minds of men.
He utterly discarded the word at that time, and has found
not the least occasion to pick it up again since, and believes
now that his substitution of the word "Value" in place of
it will ultimately be seen to have been his greatest contribution
to that Science, to which he devoted his life.</p>

<p>Even professed and excellent logicians, like John Stuart
Mill, found the word "Wealth" an insoluble element in
the science of Economics; he commenced his great work
by writing, that it was not really needful to <i>define</i> the
word which nevertheless he laid at the foundation of his
discussions, that "every one has a notion sufficiently correct
for common purposes of what is meant by Wealth";
he goes on, however, to give at least a half-dozen definitions
of the word, no two of which are at all consistent with
each other, only one of which embodies a clear and scientific
conception, and even to this one he himself does by
no means coherently adhere throughout his treatise. No
wonder, that this great man died thoroughly dissatisfied
with his own work in Economics, and wishing for longer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
life in which to recast and improve it! No wonder, too,
that the crowd of writers both English and American,
many of them able and thoughtful and otherwise logical,
who have been content to continue to use this irreducible
and utterly unscientific word at the bottom, have made a
mess of it!</p>

<p>In dropping the word, "Wealth," accordingly, Political
Economy has dropped a clog, and its movements are now
relatively free and certain; and it is all the more incumbent
on the Science for that very reason to define the good
word that it substitutes for a bad one with absolute clearness,
to explain it through and through until it become
quite transparent, and then always to use it in its defined
and economical sense, and none other, even though the
same word be properly enough used in other senses in
common speech and in other than scientific relations.
Exactly that is what we are now going to attempt to do
in a simple and consecutive order.</p>

<p>(a) Perhaps it will help us to find out precisely what
Value <i>is</i> by seeing as clearly as possible at the outset what
it is <i>not</i>. It is not <i>easy</i>, and never can be made so, to
teach and to learn distinctly what Value is in its ultimate
nature and constant changes. Here is the one unavoidable
difficulty that lies at the very threshold of Political
Economy; and this difficulty, which is not found as in the
case of "Wealth" in the meaning of the word but in the
complex character of that which the word describes, once
overmastered, and one walks thereafter with ease and pleasure
throughout the economic domain. It would be wrong
and cruel to deny that just here is one hard place in the
road for teacher and pupils to get over. It arises wholly
from the nature of the subject, as we shall soon see, and not
at all from the insufficiency of the word, Value. We have
already seen fully, that Buying and Selling in each and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
every transaction is complex and relative, involving twelve
elements every time; that Desires and Estimates and Renderings
are especially relative,&mdash;each party to a trade desires
something in possession of the other, estimates that
something relatively to something in his own possession,
and finally renders to the other his own something for the
sake of receiving the other's something. Now everybody
is used to all this and practically understands it perfectly,
but it is complicated and reciprocal nevertheless, and Value,
which is the single birth of the two Renderings, though
perfectly intelligible to him that takes pains, is not a thing
to be seized once for all at a passing trot.</p>

<p>Value, then, is <i>not</i> a quality of single things, belonging
to them as if by nature, as hardness is a quality of a rock
or gravity is an attribute of gold; because all physical
qualities in physical things, all that which makes or helps
to make anything such as it is, may be learned by a study
of the things themselves by themselves; a careful examination
and analysis of the mechanical and chemical properties
of any physical thing will discover all its distinguishing
characteristics, all that makes it that particular thing in
distinction from all other things; but it is plain already,
that the <i>Value</i> of anything (if it have value) cannot be
found out by studying that particular thing by itself alone;
the questioning of the senses however minute, the test of
the laboratory however delicate, can never determine how
much anything is <i>worth</i>, because that always implies a comparison
between <i>two</i> things, or more strictly a comparison
between two Renderings in exchange. Value is not an
attribute of single things: not even if the things be physical
and tangible.</p>

<p>Now two other kinds of things are bought and sold
besides physical and tangible things, namely, personal services
and commercial credits; and it is very plain, that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
Value cannot be a quality of any one personal service
rendered, as looked at by itself, such as the service of a
physician towards a fever patient, because the service in
and of itself might be the same whether rendered to his
own child or the child of one of his patrons, while in the
former case there would be no value, and in the latter
there would be; and so too the very name "commercial
credit" implies an exchange of two Renderings, out of
which Value always emerges, and not at all an attribute
of one credit considered by itself. Value is no more a
characteristic of single intangible services and claims than
it is of single intangible commodities rendered.</p>

<p>And what makes all this still more certain is, that Value
even in physical things, and perhaps still more in services
and claims, is all the while changing under demand and
supply, now rising and then falling, while the physical
properties of things, that make them what they are, are
fixed and unchangeable. A gold eagle, for example, has
certain primary qualities as gold, without which it would
not be gold; it is hard and heavy and colored: gold is
gold the world over and in all ages: Value is not one of
these primary qualities, nor even a secondary quality, nor
any quality at all, of gold as such; because circumstances
are readily conceived and have often occurred, in which
gold has no Value even in exchange; for instance, among
a crew abandoned at sea, a bag of gold belonging to one
of the sailors might not buy even a biscuit belonging to
another; all the natural qualities of the gold are present,&mdash;it
is still yellow and weighty and solid,&mdash;but its Value
has escaped altogether. Gold is always 19 times heavier
than water: specific gravity is a <i>quality</i> and is constant
in all physical things: Value is not a quality in this sense
at all, inasmuch as it is something that is constantly changing,
rising or falling, and not infrequently disappearing
altogether, leaving no sign.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>Ignorance of this vastly important truth has pecuniarily
ruined thousands upon thousands of the people of this
country during the last 20 years. They have gone into
the mining of metals, gold and silver and copper, sometimes
as individuals and more often as companies gathering
in the driblets of investors, under the notion that if
they could only get these metals out of the ground their
Value would be just as secure and fixed as their physical
qualities. They found out their mistake in bitterness of
spirit. For example, the Value of an ounce of silver has
gone down and down and down as the quantity of silver
excavated has increased under zealous digging, in accordance
with the universal and pitiless law of Supply and
Demand. So of copper. And both these great monetary
interests went to Congress and secured the passage of laws
designed to lift artificially the Values that were sinking
naturally under increased Supply, the silver men by a law
requiring the United States to buy and mint at least
$2,000,000 in silver each month whether the silver dollars
were needed or not, and the copper men by a law imposing
a tariff-tax on foreign copper that has actually lifted the
price two cents a pound on the average of the whole 20
years above the average price of copper in the markets of
the world.</p>

<p>Take another illustration of disappearing Values, this
time in lands, long supposed to be the most stable in value
of all human possessions. Whole tiers of farms in the
writer's native town in New Hampshire, and for that matter
all over New England as well, that in his boyhood
supported large families, and when sold usually brought a
fair price, are now abandoned of their owners as wholly or
comparatively worthless, and are allowed to grow up into
forest again, without a sign of present human habitation
upon them. Value is something that needs to be studied
carefully, if it is to be fully understood.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>(b) Perhaps the origin of the word, "Value," will throw
some light upon its nature and changes. Etymology can
never be safely despised in scientific discussions, although
words are perpetually changing their meaning in the mouths
of men. No science can afford to build upon the transient
meaning of a word; and yet it is clearly possible so to use
words as to reach and describe ultimate and unchanging facts
in science; and some knowledge of the original meaning of
words is always a help in getting at those definitions and
analyses of facts that are permanent in science. Let us
hold fast to the cheering truth exemplified on all sides of
every science, that a just analysis and exact description
of ultimate facts in any department of knowledge are for
all time, in spite of the transient meaning of current words.</p>

<p>The present word is derived from the Latin <span class="smcap">Valere</span>, <i>to
pass for, to be worth</i>. There is a strong hint of a <i>comparison</i>
in the original meaning of the word, and the current
use of it both in Latin and English develops the hint into
a certainty. In common language, when the Value of
anything is asked for, the answer always comes in the
terms of something else. If the question be, How much
is it worth? the answer is, So many dollars or cents.
Now the cents or dollars are very different things from
those whose value is thus inquired after; and so we see
again from another point of view that Value is a relative
matter, since it clearly implies a comparison between two
distinct things; and, if so, it is clearly enough not a quality
of any one thing, and of course it would be useless to try
to ascertain the Value of anything by a study of that thing
alone. Etymology thus easily brings us up to our present
vital question, and will assist us to solve it completely.</p>

<p>(c) <i>What is Value?</i> Plainly it is the result of a comparison
instituted between two things, using the word,
"things," here in its broadest sense. But who institutes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
the comparison? And who is competent to announce the
result of it in Value? A comparison is required in order
to ascertain the length of a stick of timber in feet and
inches, and a carpenter's square is the instrument by which
the comparison is made, and it makes no difference in the
result whose the square is or whose the stick of timber is,
since the square and the stick have in common the physical
quality of length, and a simple comparison of square with
stick determines the length of the latter, and one man in
this case may determine the result by himself alone, and
it is not needful that he be the <i>owner</i> of either of the
things compared.</p>

<p>But it is a different kind of comparison from this that
issues in Value. Let us suppose an exchange of a bushel
of wheat for a mason's trowel: there is no common physical
quality, as length, between the wheat and the trowel;
and it is evident, that no <i>one</i> man can measure in any form
one of these two commodities by means of the other. It
is a peculiar kind of comparison that is involved in any
and every trade; and the first peculiarity of it is, as we
have already seen in another connection, that it always
requires "two persons" to make it; and each of the two
persons must always be the virtual <i>owner</i> of one of the
two things exchanged. A thief may indeed go through
the motions of selling a stolen horse, but as he is not the
owner of the horse there can be no sale, and the actual
owner may take his horse wherever he finds it even in the
hands of an innocent third party. In other words, there
must ever be "two efforts" also, two legitimate efforts
giving a valid claim of ownership to each of the two parties
in the exchange.</p>

<p>And there is a second distinctive peculiarity in that
comparison that ends in Value, namely, the two things
to be exchanged are not compared directly with each other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
at all, as square and stick are compared, but in the light
of the "two desires" with which we are already familiar,
and in that of the "two estimates" resulting therefrom.
The owner of the wheat desires a trowel, and the owner
of the trowel desires a bushel of wheat; the former estimates
the effort it has already cost him to procure the
wheat in a sort of comparison with the effort that it would
otherwise cost him to procure the trowel, and he does not
trade unless the trowel seem more and better to him than
does the wheat; the latter estimates the effort it has cost
him to procure the trowel in a sort of comparison with
the effort it would cost him to procure otherwise the wheat
that he wants, and he does not trade unless the wheat then
and there seem more desirable than the trowel, which he
already has; and these two relative estimates of the two
owners must <i>coincide</i>, that is, the owner of the wheat must
think more of the trowel than of the wheat, and the owner
of the trowel must think more of the wheat than of the
trowel, before these two parties can ever trade. So of all
traffic whatsoever.</p>

<p>Now the third and last distinctive peculiarity of that
kind of comparison out of which Value emerges is this,&mdash;an
<i>action</i> is necessary in order to complete the comparison.
Desires and estimates may have been never so busy, but
no Value can ever be born until an outward action takes
place in the "two renderings" of our former analysis.
Then first we come out upon plain and solid ground. We
leave the play of the subjective elements, which yet are
essential in the premises, and touch firmly objective realities.
<i>The trowel-maker passes over his tool in the sight of
men to the wheat-grower in firm possession and ownership, and
takes in return for it from him the grain, which the latter
passes over to the former for the sake of receiving the trowel.</i>
The two "satisfactions" follow as a matter of course, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
that whole transaction as a commercial exchange and as
the sole subject of Political Economy is ended.</p>

<p><i>But where is the "Value," of which we have been in
search?</i> The answer is easy and certain and unevadible.
<i>The Value is in the Renderings, and nowhere else.</i> The
value of the trowel is the wheat, that is actually given in
exchange for it; and the value of the wheat is equally
the trowel, for the sake of getting which the wheat was
rendered. What was the Value of King Hiram's cedar-timbers?
The oil and wheat actually returned in pay for
them. What was the Value of the oil and wheat sent
northward by King Solomon? The timbers rendered in
direct exchange for the same. This is not merely the only
possible answer to the question, <i>What is Value?</i> but it is
also a perfectly complete and satisfactory answer. Common
language here corresponds exactly with scientific
language. "How much did the horse cost?" "One
hundred dollars." The dollars have nothing whatever
in common with the horse, except that they express his
Value at the time; the horse has nothing in common with
the dollars, except that it expresses the Value of the dollars
at the time. It is just as exact to say, it means
precisely the same thing to say, the dollars are worth the
horse, as to say, the horse is worth the dollars.</p>

<p>In general terms, the Value of anything is something
else received in return for it, when each owner renders the
one <i>for the sake of</i> getting the other. This is the whole of
it, so far as any specific valuable thing is concerned. We
shall indeed need after a little, and shall have no trouble
in finding, an abstract and universal definition of "<i>Value</i>,"
as an abstract and scientific term perfectly circumscribing
the field of Economics. Here and now we are dealing
with the simpler concrete question, What is the value of
any specific valuable thing? The unvarying answer is,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
Some other specific valuable thing already exchanged for
the first! There may be expected value, estimated value,
but actual value there is none, until a real exchange has
settled how much the value is. The value of anything is
something else already exchanged for it. Value is not
simply a relation subsisting between two things, the result
of a careful comparison between them, but rather an
actual fact established in connection with them. The universal
formula of Value is <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">quid pro quo</i>, in which
formula <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">quid</i> stands for one of the valuables
and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">quo</i> for the other,
and <i>pro</i> unfolds the motive of each owner for the reciprocal
receiving and rendering.</p>

<p>Here a caution is needful. Because nobody can tell
what the value of anything is until something else has
been put over against it in order to get it and actually
received therefor, and because the only possible way to
express the value of either is in the terms of the other,&mdash;the
trowel is worth the wheat and the wheat is worth the
trowel,&mdash;one must not therefore jump to the conclusion
that the value of either is settled for all time or even for
any future time. It is only settled for <i>this</i> time. In
Economics as in Christianity, Now is the accepted time.
There is nothing fixed in Values, and never can be from
the nature of the case, because Desires are personal to
individuals, and Efforts fluctuate with times and persons,
and Estimates that wait on these vary from necessity, and
the Renderings of to-day may not be the chosen renderings
of other persons in the same articles to-morrow. Value is
not a quality at all, still less is it a permanent quality, of
anything; it is a relation established between two things
when these are in the hands of two given persons; but
now when these are in the hands of two different persons,
whose views are pretty sure to differ from the former, and
a new relation is sought to be established between these in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
the old way of Estimates, is it strange that a new balance
is struck, and Value is expressed in quite different terms?</p>

<p>One of the chief charms of Political Economy is the
open secret, that it deals not with rigidities and inflexible
qualities and mathematical quantities and the unchanging
laws of matter, but with the billowy play of desires and
estimates and purposes and satisfactions, all of which are
mental states, and all of which are subject in the general
to ascertainable laws, though laws of a quite different kind
from those of Mechanics. Values come and they go.
Within certain limits and under certain conditions they
may be anticipated and even predicted, but never with the
precision of an eclipse or the result of a known chemical
combination. There is a useful and fascinating Science of
Value, as we shall see indubitably by and by in the present
chapter; but it is a science that deals primarily with <i>persons</i>
and only secondarily with <i>things</i>, with mind and not
with matter, with the general undulations of the sea and
not with the crests of the waves. And all this is so,
because Values are relative, because the announcements in
the market-place to-day may stand listed differently to-morrow
and very differently next year, and because old
values may disappear altogether and many new ones come
in, all in accordance with the incessant changes in the
wants and labors and fashions and projects of men.</p>

<p>We are now in a good place to see once for all the sharp
distinction there is between Utility and Value. These
two are often confounded to the deep detriment of our
Science; and no clear thinking is possible in Economics
without drawing this line sharp, and then holding it fast;
for the hazard of this confusion is all the greater, because
Utility is always connected with Value, although it is a
totally different thing from Value. We will see. Utility
is the simple capacity of anything to gratify the desire of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
anybody. This is at once the etymological as well as the
popular signification of the word. It is derived from the
Latin <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">utor</i>, to make use of, a word that is often conjoined
in Latin with <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">fruor</i>, to enjoy; so much so, that the two
verbs are often put together, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">utor et fruor</i>, and also often
without the conjunctive, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">utor fruor</i>. Utility, then, is a
quality of innumerable things. Anything that is <i>good for</i>
anything, anything <i>useful</i>, anything that has the power to
still <i>the desires</i> of any person, has Utility. But multitudes
of things that have this capacity to gratify human
desires are never bought and sold, and therefore can have
no Value, since nobody will give anything for them. The
air we breathe, the water we refresh ourselves with from
spring or brook, the light of the sun and moon and stars,
the fragrance of the flowers, the mountain prospect that
delights the eye,&mdash;all these, and thousands more, possess
the highest utility, but no value whatsoever. They are
free. They are the bounty of God. They are never bought
and sold. They are a vast class of things by themselves,
with which Political Economy as such has nothing to do.</p>

<p>Nevertheless the element of Utility comes into every
case of Value, because the element of Desire comes into
every case of Value, and whatever merely satisfies the
Desire of any person is Utility, whether that capacity be
the direct gift of God or whether the Efforts of men have
been employed to bring it about. It is just here that we
see the precise function of our "two efforts" in each case
of Value, in distinction from mere Utility in all cases:
much of utility is absolutely free, no effort of men having
been put forth to secure it, for example, the fragrance of
the wild rose; much more of utility is the commingled
bounty of Nature and the gratuitous effort of men, for
example, the fragrance of the domestic rose brought by
the householder himself into his own yard for the gratification
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
of his own family; while by much the most of
utility is commingled free gift of God and the compensated
efforts of men, for example, the fragrance of the
bank of roses cultivated and cared for by the hired gardener.
It is important for our purposes to discriminate
carefully the three kinds of Utility: (1) what is wholly
disconnected from the efforts of men, and comes freely
from the hand of God; (2) what is mingled with the
unpaid efforts of men, so that the satisfaction of the desire
comes partly from Nature and partly from unbought
effort; and (3) the compound utility that is partly free
gift and partly the result of compensated labor. The last
is the only kind of Utility that stands in any connection
with Value.</p>

<p>And even this is very different from Value. Utility in
all three of its forms&mdash;now free, now onerous, now partly
bought&mdash;is always a quality of one thing by itself, going
straight to the satisfaction of some desire, and there an
end. It is simplicity itself compared with Value, which
is always a resultant of several things, and is specifically
a relation of mutual purchase established between two
"renderings," each of which expresses the value of the
other, in each of which is embodied an "effort" made by
each of the two "persons" rendering, and each of which
excites a "desire" and an "estimate" before being passed
over in ownership to another, and a "satisfaction" afterwards.</p>

<p>The utility in every valuable rendering comes partly
from free Nature and partly from compensated effort, but
it is remarkable, that a principle, with which we are to
become very familiar later on, namely, Competition, eliminates
for the most part from all influence upon Value that
portion of the Utility that is the free gift of God. The
great Father never takes pay for anything, and never
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
authorizes anybody to take pay in his behalf; and, moreover,
has arranged things so, that it is exceedingly difficult
for any person to extort anything from another person
on the strength of anything that God has made, and man
has not improved. Take, for example, ten horses of any
general grade, brought into the same market by their ten
owners for sale. These men did not make these horses,
but they have cared for and trained them, or at least have
become proprietors by purchase or otherwise of the results
of such care and training. The Utility in each horse is
compound, consisting partly of what God has done for
him and partly of what man has done for him,&mdash;the two
parts inextricably interwoven,&mdash;and all ten are offered
now for sale. Each of the owners would indeed be glad
to get something for his horse on the ground of what God
has done to make him sound and strong and fleet, in addition
to a fair compensation for what he (and his predecessors)
has done in raising and breaking him; but the
cupidity of all is likely to be thwarted by the ultimate
willingness of some to sell their horses for a price covering
the element of human "efforts" involved, and the action
of these tends to fix a general rate for the whole ten, and
thus the gratuitous element is eliminated from influence
on Value. Even if the ten owners should combine for a
higher price, there are doubtless a plenty of horses of that
general grade elsewhere, some of whose owners are content
to get back an equivalent for their own and others'
"efforts" expended on their horses; and so the action of
these tends to fix the general price for horses of that kind
for that time and place at a point not above a fair estimate
of the onerous human elements involved; thus throwing
out by the action of competition all effect of natural Utility
upon the Value of horses then and there. So of all other
products of that kind.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>It is true, that in certain unique cases, in which competition
has little or no play, because there is only one or
a very few owners of such unique products, one cannot
certainly say that free Utility may <i>not</i> influence the Value
to lift it above the gauge of human efforts involved; but
such cases are rare, and relatively unimportant; and the
tendency is immensely strong, under the natural and beneficial
condition of things, for Values to graduate themselves
through the reciprocal estimates and renderings of commerce,
down to the actual and onerous contribution of <i>men</i>
to that Utility that underlies Value.</p>

<p>Thus we are brought again and again from differing
points of view to the "two renderings" as central and
determinative in Value, and also more specifically to the
"two efforts" of persons rather than any free contribution
of Nature as constituting that portion of the compound
Utility, whose function it is to gratify the "two desires"
that precede the realization of Value,&mdash;that portion of the
utility in any rendering that must be <i>compensated for</i> by
the other rendering. Now in order to reach in a moment
more our final definition of "Value," a definition, it is
believed, that will cover all the cases and take the life out
of endless disputes, we need a scientific term to carry easily
and exactly the meaning of any economic <i>rendering</i>. Let
that word be <span class="smcap">Service</span>. We must have it in its generalized
meaning, to cover the renderings of all the three kinds, in
distinction from the term "personal services," which we
have already used and shall continue to use to designate
one class only of things exchanged, in contradistinction
to "commodities" and to "credits," the other two classes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Value is the relation of mutual purchase established
between two services by their exchange.</span></p>

<p>We offer this definition of "Value" to our readers in
much confidence, that they will find it exact and adequate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
and altogether trustworthy. No one of them, however, is
precluded from attempts to improve it in breadth and
brevity and beauty; and all are invited to pick logical
flaws in it, whether of ambiguity or superfluity or deficiency.
Many minds and many hands in many lands have
left their impress on parts of this definition, for example,
Aristotle in Greece and Bastiat in France and Macleod in
Great Britain; the present writer thinks, that he has bettered
the definition of Bastiat, namely, "<i>Value is the relation
of two services exchanged</i>," by precisely <i>defining</i> the
relation as one of mutual purchase; and he is sure, that
he has improved the definition of Macleod, namely, "<i>The
value of any economic quantity is any other economic quantity
for which it can be exchanged</i>," by making his definition
at once more abstract and more general and more definite,
and also by escaping the slight implication in the word,
"quantity," that only material things are exchanged in
economics.</p>

<p>The immense importance of securing <i>first</i> a clear and
correct Definition of "Value," which is the foundation-word
and the circumference-word of Political Economy,
and <i>then</i> of using that term and all other scientific terms
in the Science in their defined senses only, will certainly
be appreciated by those who have wandered in the wide
wilderness of the discussions on the undefinable word,
"Wealth," and especially by those who have reflected
most upon the vast and illimitable significance of economic
Exchanges on the welfare of mankind. Associate
Justice Miller of the Supreme Court of the United States,
not an Economist in the technical sense, referred in 1888,
in words that are worth remembering, to "<i>the philosophical
maxim of modern times, that of all the agencies of civilization
and progress of the human race commerce is the most
efficient</i>." In August of that year John Sherman of Ohio,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
a man far enough from being a technical Economist, said
in the Senate of the United States, that "<i>it is almost a
crime against civilization</i>" to maintain commercial barriers
between Canada and the United States.</p>

<p>There were tokens a plenty in the year of Grace just
referred to, that the Science of Value in all the lands of
the civilized world, and particularly in the United States,
was drawing to itself a new and more popular esteem. It
was seen more clearly and felt more deeply than ever
before, that this science has a weighty word for every man
and woman and child in the world; that there are certain
Rights in every one inherent and inalienable to buy and
sell for his own advantage; that most if not all of the
Governments, under the lead of comparatively few selfish
and powerful men, were infringing upon these Rights, and
robbing under the forms of Law the masses of their citizens
to immense amounts for the special benefit of these
very men; that the only sure defences of the people
against these abuses of all kinds were in the maintenance
and diffusion of the scientific and consequently disinterested
principles and maxims of a sound Political Economy;
that such a science was only friendly to the broadest
rights, to universal gains, to illimitable increase in human
comforts and powers, to international fellowship, to peace
on earth and good-will among men; that, accordingly, a
science of such scope and tendencies must be encouraged
and cultivated and improved; that what had been crude
in it, and narrow, and merely national, must be sloughed
off; that the English and insular and special speculations
of a century ago, which regarded "Wealth" as consisting
of material things only, excepting however considerable
portions of Adam Smith's immortal book, were antiquated
and unusable; that the Science had really moved into a
broader and still a well-circumscribed field, new and more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
permanent foundations were being laid, and fresh contributions
from all countries should be welcomed; and that
the time had fully come, when the accepted truths of this
Science, like those of the other developed sciences, should
be practically and steadily applied to the betterment of
mankind. Under these broadening and inspiriting and
uplifting conditions Political Economy, as never before,
thanked God and took courage.</p>

<p>3. Having now a satisfactory definition of Value, and
knowing accordingly just what Valuables are in clear distinction
from all other things in the world, we must
examine with some care two or three of the most general
facts and laws and limits of Value, before we pass in the
next following chapters to study in detail each of the three
kinds of Valuables, namely, material Commodities, personal
Services, commercial Credits.</p>

<p>(a) Since Value in general is the relation of mutual
purchase between two Services, and consequently the specific
value of either can only be expressed by the other,&mdash;one
Valuable being always measured by the Valuable
exchanged against it,&mdash;it follows as a matter of course
that such a thing as a general Rise or Fall of Valuables
is an impossibility. The rise of one valuable involves of
necessity a fall in the other, as the fall of one implies the
rise of the other. If the articles exchanged be bushels of
wheat and dollars of silver, and if a bushel buys a dollar
to-day, then wheat is worth a dollar a bushel; but if wheat
rises next week, so that a dollar will not buy a full bushel,
that is precisely the same thing as saying, that the dollar
has fallen in its purchasing-power as compared with the
wheat. Such specific changes in the purchasing-power of
one Valuable over another are incessant throughout the
commercial world, and a merchant's sagacity consists in
anticipating these so far as possible and in availing himself
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
of them alertly and prudently; but each one of us must
needs see clearly and hold firmly in mind, that each fall in
the purchasing-power of a Valuable means a corresponding
rise of power in the other Valuable,&mdash;if the first buys
more of the second than before, then the second must buy
less than before of the first; and, consequently, a general
rise of Valuables is a contradiction in terms, and so of
course is a general fall of Valuables.</p>

<p>This brings us to <i>Price</i>. Price is Value reckoned in
money; and this is the only difference in the meaning of
the two terms. When one valuable is sold against another,
even when one of the two is money, each is the <i>Value</i> of
the other: Value is the general and universal term in
Economics. When any other valuable is sold against
money, the amount of money it buys is called its <i>Price</i>:
Price is a specific and restricted term in Economics. Since
we shall study Money thoroughly in a later chapter, and
there explain the origin and extent of its functions throughout,
it is only in order to remark here, that it is for convenience'
sake, that is, to make easy the comparison of
valuables one with another, that Value in commerce is
commonly reduced to Price. Money becomes a sort of
measure, by means of which to compare all other valuables
with each other. In order to ascertain the Price of a Valuable,
it only needs to be sold once against money; but
in order to ascertain the Value of a Valuable, it would
need to be sold once against all other valuables whatsoever.
This last is clearly impracticable; and so Value
for practical purposes is reduced to Price. The General
is made Particular for convenience. Hence we have
"Prices current," but never Values current.</p>

<p>Now it will be plain to all, how there may easily be and
often is a general rise or fall of Prices while a rise or fall
of Values is impossible. Price is a relative word as much
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
as Value is, but it does not relate to so many things.
Price is specific, and Value universal. Both equally
involve buying and selling, but one sale of a single valuable
against money leads to Price, while ten thousand sales of
the same valuable against other than money would not
conduct to complete Value. That would require a sale of
this valuable against all other valuables in the world, and
a complete statement of the comparative results.</p>

<p>General, or at least universal, changes of Prices in rise
or fall in any given country are due to general and great
changes in the Money current there. Subordinate changes
in other valuables, money being supposed to remain uniform,
will of course vary their Prices; but it is impossible
that such changes should affect equally or even generally
all the various and numberless valuables of a whole country;
while some are coming easier, others are coming
harder, while some are more desired than formerly others
are less desired, and this will bring in of course altered
prices, some higher and some lower; but a general rise of
all prices, or a general fall in the same, can only come
about by great changes of some kind in the circulating
medium, that is, the money, of the country. For example,
in the United States, between 1862 and 1878 inclusive, a
government paper promise, called <i>greenbacks</i>, was the current
money of the country; owing to its excessive issue,
and to some doubt in the minds of the people whether the
paper would ever be redeemed in gold, it soon became
depreciated as compared with gold, the premium on which
over the paper money varied at different times from 1 to
185 <i>per centum</i>; as all other valuables were then sold
against greenback money, which had declined, their prices
naturally rose in some sort of proportion as the medium
fell; general <i>values</i> remained much as before, but general
<i>prices</i> were much enhanced; and when, after the resumption
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
of specie payments in January, 1879, gold became
again the standard medium, general prices declined in full
accordance with the same universal principle reversed.</p>

<p>(b) Prices, as we have now seen, are only a subordinate
form of Values: the universal law that regulates all the
variations of them both, within certain fixed limits to be
examined shortly, is called the <span class="smcap">Law of Supply and
Demand</span>. This is perhaps the most comprehensive and
beautiful law in Political Economy. We shall look at it
now only in outline: the filling in will be the pastime and
profit of all that is to come.</p>

<p>"Demand" is a technical term in Economics, and accordingly
needs to be defined, and then always used in its
defined sense. So is "Supply." <i>Demand is the "desire"
of a "person" for something in the hands of another person,
coupled with the possession of something else capable of
buying that something.</i> Mere desire has no function in
Political Economy: hungry and penniless children passing
by the stalls of a great market, have no influence on the
prices or values of the viands, on which they cast their
eager glances: only desires accompanied by "efforts"
competent to excite the desires and to pay for the efforts
of another are a Demand. Supply is the same thing
as Demand looked at from the other side. Supply is the
correlative of Demand. The Supplyer is a person, who
has in his possession something desired by the Demander,
and who in turn desires something in the hands of the
Demander, when both are willing to exchange their "renderings."
There is no economical difference in the position
of the Demander and the Supplyer. Each is equally a
Demand and a Supply with reference to the other. It is
the old and ever-recurring case of Value, the propositions
being here stated in their most universal terms.</p>

<p>For simplicity's sake, however, and for convenience,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
without altering the substance of the definitions a particle,
the valuables when looked at as a Demand are practically
reduced in all markets to their equivalent in Money,
so that Money offered or ready to be offered against any
other exchangeable thing constitutes what is called in
commercial language a Demand; and this is sufficiently
accurate as well as current, although it must always be
remembered that each valuable in any market in reality
constitutes a Demand for another, and is equally a Supply
in reference to that other. <i>Supply is any exchangeable
thing offered for sale against any other exchangeable thing.</i>
For example, corn in any market is at bottom a Demand
and a Supply at once for every valuable offered in that
market at that time, say, ploughs for one thing; but in
the talk of the market, the presence of corn there, or its
being ready to be immediately brought there and offered
in exchange for money, constitutes what is called a Supply
of corn; money offered, or ready to be offered, in exchange
for corn, constitutes what is called a Demand.</p>

<p>On this account Money seems to play a much more
important part in trade than it actually does play; the
corn is sold in the terms of money, that is, for dollars
and cents as denominations of Value; convenience dictates
such a reduction of general Value to this particular
form of it, because this is found to make easier the ultimate
exchange; but there is not one chance in a hundred,
as trade runs nowadays in the larger markets, that this
seller of corn will take his pay for it in actual money
whether metallic or paper; money is never an ultimate
product, but only an intermediate one; this seller of corn
wants perhaps a plough or some other farming implement,
and ten to one he will take for his corn a bill or order in
some form on the seller of ploughs, and it will be corn
for a plough, each becoming a Demand and a Supply for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
the other, though money or rather its denominations has
acted as an agent in bringing about the final trade; the
details of all this in manner and result will be as plain as
day when we come to study "Money" and "Credits" in
following chapters; while the essential point to be noted
here is, that all Valuables are a Demand and Supply
as towards one another. In other words, the world over,
<span class="smcap">A market for products is products in market</span>.</p>

<p>What, then, is Market-Value returned in the terms of
Money? And what is the universal Law of it?</p>

<p>Market-value is the present rate of exchange between
dollars and cents and any other valuable, that can be fairly
graded in a class made up of valuables similar to itself;
and the law of market-value is the equation of Supply and
Demand, that is, the current rate is adjusted when money
enough is offered to take off within the usual times the
valuables on hand and offered for sale. If Demand for
any reason become quickened, and the Supply be not
increased, there is competition among buyers for the stock
in market, and the market-rate rises or tends to rise. If,
on the other hand, Demand become sluggish, the Supply
remaining the same, there is a like competition among the
sellers to dispose of their stock, and market-value sinks
or tends to sink. So far it is the simple action on Value
of the element of one "desire" expressing itself through
a money-demand, the elements of "desire" and of "efforts"
expressing themselves through Supply being supposed to
remain stable, and the pulsations in the market-rate follow
accordingly.</p>

<p>How far can this simple action go? Demand increasing,
Supply remaining as before, market-rate rises: how far
can it rise from this cause? Here we must remember that
Demand not only acts upon Value, but also Value reacts
upon Demand. As Value rises, the number of those whose
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
means or inclinations enable them to purchase at the new
rate is constantly diminished: there are ten persons who
may wish an article at one dollar, of whom not over four
will wish it at two dollars, and perhaps only one at three
dollars. Every rise in market-rate then, under the impulse
of enlarged Demand, tends to cut off a part of that Demand,
that is, to lessen the number of those who will purchase
at the increased price; and the rate consequently
can only rise to that point, whatever it be, where an equalization
takes place between the Supply and Demand,
between the quantity of flour, for example, offered at the
enhanced rate, and the quantity of money in the hands of
those willing to exchange it for flour at the higher rate.</p>

<p>Just so in the reverse way, when Demand is slackened,
Supply continuing as before, the market-rate is sure to
decline; but declining rates tend strongly in turn to increase
the demand by bringing the article within the range
of a larger number of purchasers; Society is like a pyramid,
each lower stratum is broader than the one above;
and so the decline of rates under a weaker Demand is
arrested by a stronger Demand coming from a wider circle
of buyers, and a new market-rate is determined at the
point of equalization between the new Demand and the
old Supply. Thus every rise or fall of Demand tends to
check itself, and will check itself in all the great classes of
valuables, even without any variations in the Supply;
everything oscillates under the variations of Demand;
while the point of stable equilibrium, if we may use the
expression of anything so unstable as Market-value, is
always the equation of Supply and Demand.</p>

<p>But all considerable variations of market-rate are commonly
checked at an earlier point than the one just indicated
by variations in the Supply. A sharper Demand
carries up the market-rate, and a higher market-rate commonly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
acts upon Supply to enlarge it, and an increased
Supply too checks the rise of market-rate. <i>Per contra</i>, a
slacker Demand lowers market-rates, and lowered rates
often lessen the Supply by the action of holders and speculators,&mdash;holders
withdrawing their stock for a better
market, and speculators buying now when the article is
cheap to store away until it shall be dearer. Thus rise of
market-rate from Demand growing stronger is checked
doubly; first, by curtailing the number of would-be buyers,
and second, by enlarging the Supply: the fall of market-rate
from Demand growing weaker is checked doubly;
first, by increasing the number of consumers of a now
cheaper article, and second, by a diminution of Supply by
the action of holders and speculators. This double and
harmonious working of the law of the Equalization of
Demand and Supply is one of the most comprehensive and
beautiful laws in Political Economy.</p>

<p>Besides this, we must note the effect on Value of conditions
in Supply only, Demand being supposed to continue
steady. There are three classes of valuables in respect to
the law of their Supply. (1) When the Supply is scant,
and cannot be increased at all, as is the case with choice
antiques and certain gems and paintings by the old masters,
their value may rise to any point under the action of
Demand, there is and can be in such cases no market-rate,
and the individual value will be struck at the point of
equalization of the demand then existing with the supply
there offered. For instance, the French Government paid,
in 1852, 615,300 francs for a painting by Murillo, which
had belonged to Marshal Soult. The genuine Murillos
are comparatively few, and their number cannot be increased,
and their merit causes a strong "desire" to possess
them, and their value rises in connection with the limitation
of Supply to a point beyond which no one purchaser
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
can be found. When this painting was offered in Paris
for sale, many "persons" of course were anxious to buy it,
there was but one painting, there could be but one purchaser,
value rose under the influence of a sharp Demand,
the rise could not be checked by any duplication of the
Supply, and the equation was complete and the value for
that sale determined when one party distanced all other
competitors and offered a sum greater than any one else
would give. The same principle controls all sales of this
sort, and is practically the principle of the <i>Auction</i>, whose
very name indicates its nature in this regard, that Demand
becomes restricted to one party, and that the highest
bidder.</p>

<p>(2) When the Supply, instead of being absolutely
limited, can only be increased with difficulty or after the
lapse of time, similar but less extreme results will be
observed. Let us suppose, that pianos are selling in some
rural community at $300 each, that there are twenty persons
in the place who want a piano immediately, that there are
but fifteen pianos on hand, and that the number cannot be
increased for half a year. The market-rate will certainly
rise above $300. How much above? To that point, at
which only fifteen of the twenty will be willing to purchase
at the new rate. The equation of Supply and
Demand will be reached by a rising rate which cuts off
five competitors. This is the principle, working only
roughly in practice through the estimates and good judgment
of dealers and purchasers. A better illustration of
this second class of cases is, perhaps, the Grains and other
agricultural products. When these have been gathered,
there is no more home supply for a year; and any deficiency
in the crops will raise their market-rate, not at all
in the ratio of the deficiency, but according to the relations
of the diminished Supply to a new Demand. Since the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
abolition of the Corn-Laws in England in 1846, and the
resulting ease of grain-imports from abroad, a deficiency
of home crops has no such effect on the price of cereals as
it had before that time; when, according to Tooke's History
of Prices, an expected falling-off of one third in the
crops often doubled and sometimes quadrupled the usual
prices; which shows that the world ought to become one
country in respect to all food supplies, as indeed happily it
is now for the most part, each country allowing them to be
distributed freely everywhere in accordance with this law
of Demand and Supply. Speculation is more busy in grain,
in cotton, and in such things generally, because a new
Supply can only be had once a year; early information is
eagerly sought at the trade centres in regard to the prospects
of the growing crops, and has its influence one way
or the other on current prices; but the world is so wide
and all the parts of it now so closely connected together
by steamship and telegraph, that the prices of the great
food staples are remarkably uniform over the earth, and
Speculation has not the chance it once had to count and
"corner."</p>

<p>(3) In the only remaining and by far most comprehensive
class of cases, in which the Supply of Commodities and
Services and Credits can be readily and indefinitely
increased to meet enhanced Demand, and easily withdrawn
from market and stored when Demand declines,
each rise and fall of market-rate tends to be speedily
checked through the mere action of Supply; and the
doubly and harmoniously working Law but just now
referred to keeps Value in this class of cases comparatively
steady all over the world.</p>

<p>(c) It only remains in this branch of the general discussion
on Value, to indicate the Limits, within which all
oscillations of Value are contained. These extreme limits
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
are specially to be found in the element of Value which
we have called "Efforts." We have clearly seen already,
that "efforts" (or Labor) are not, as has been often
asserted, the cause of Value, but only one of several constituent
causes; if Labor be asserted to be the sole cause
of Value, the inquiry becomes instantly pertinent, what
is the cause of the value of Labor; yet we know, that
"efforts" always stand in preconnection with value, and,
the mutual "desires" being presupposed, there must
always be Limitations of Value lying partly in the efforts
made by the person serving and partly in the efforts saved
to the person served. In every valuable transaction, each
of the parties is reciprocally serving and served, and it is
clear, that the two would not exchange "renderings"
unless the service which each renders to the other is less
onerous than the "efforts" which each would have to
make if each served himself directly. For example, it
takes a certain effort for me to bring water from the spring
for the use of my family; I am willing to pay a neighbor
for bringing it for me, but I should not be willing to make
a greater effort for him in return than the effort is to
bring it myself; neither should I be willing to make an
effort for him in return which I regarded just as onerous
as the bringing the water myself; and unless there is some
service which he will accept less onerous to me than that,
I shall continue to bring the water. On the other hand,
he will surely not render the service to me of bringing the
water, unless it be less onerous to him to do so than the
doing that for himself which I am ready to do for him.</p>

<p>This principle, applicable to all exchanges whatsoever,
draws on the one side the outermost line, beyond which
Value never can pass. It may be asserted with confidence,
that no person will ever knowingly make a greater effort
to satisfy a desire through exchange, than the effort needful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
to satisfy it without an exchange. Therefore, it follows,
that all exchanges lessen onerous efforts among men
relatively to the satisfaction of their desires, and tend to
lessen these more and more as exchanges multiply in number
and variety, otherwise the exchanges would not take
place.</p>

<p>Moreover, within this outermost Limit of Value, which
is made by the comparative onerousness of the respective
"efforts," there is a second limitation of a similar kind to
be found specially in the element which we have called
"estimates." The estimate of each exchanger is based at
once on his own effort about to be rendered and on his
desire for the return service offered: the element of effort
in the case of both being considered for the time as fixed,
Value will vary according to the varying desire of each
for the return service of the other, affecting of course the
"estimate" of each, and furnishing also a secondary Limit
of Value. To pursue the same illustration, suppose I
regard the effort required to bring the water myself as 10;
that there are several persons, who would be glad to do
that service for me at a return service which I consider as
8; that there are two persons, who are willing to do it for
something which I estimate at 6; and that there is only
one person, who will do it for a return service which I
regard as 5. It is evident, that the extreme limits of that
service to me are 10 and 5. Higher than 10 it cannot go,
lower than 5 it cannot sink. But why have I before me
three possible classes of renderers? Because the persons in
each class, while estimating their own efforts alike in the
proposed rendering to me, have varying "desires" as
towards a possible rendering from me to them, and consequently
put differing "estimates" upon the possible transactions.
The man who will bring the water for 5 has for
some reason (no matter what) a stronger desire for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
return than anybody else, and I should of course employ
him so long as he would serve me on those terms; if he
decline the exchange, I fall back on one of the two persons
in the class above him, and Value rises now from 5 to 6,
and will be steadier there than it was before; if each of
these in turn should give out, I should fall back upon the
larger class ready to serve me at 8, and Value would be
very steady at that rate, because there are numerous competitors;
and by no possibility could it rise above 10.
Between 10 and 5 the value may fluctuate, but it cannot
overpass these Limits in either direction under existing
circumstances.</p>

<p>Therefore we may conclude, that the <i>maximum</i> Value of
any Service in exchange will be struck at the point where
the recipient will prefer to serve himself, or go without the
satisfaction, rather than make the exchange; and the <i>minimum</i>
Value of any Service in exchange is struck at the
point below which the recipient cannot get himself served
even by him who most highly estimates the return service
offered.</p>

<p>(4) We come now to the last and most important Inquiry
in this initial chapter, namely this, <i>Can there be, and is
there, a strict Science of Buying and Selling? Is there a
Science by itself, clear and certain, that covers and controls
Valuables?</i></p>

<p>Here we must go slowly, if we would go surely. We
must first find out exactly what a Science is in general,
and then ascertain in particular whether Political Economy
bears all the marks and stands all the tests of the
other genuine Sciences. What is a Science?</p>

<p><i>A Science is the body of exact definitions and sound principles
educed from and applied to a single class of facts or
phenomena.</i></p>

<p>The very first condition, accordingly, of any science is,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
that there be a single class of facts, objective or subjective,
that can be separated from all other classes of facts, in the
mind by a generalization and in words by a definition, and
that such generalization and definition be clearly made and
held; the second condition is, that the class of facts so circumscribed
and defined be open to some or all of the logical
processes of construction, of which the most important
are Induction and Deduction; the third condition is, that
the subordinate definitions and working principles within
the inchoate Science be all educed from and applied to
these circumscribed facts in strict accordance with these
well-known logical processes; and the last condition is,
that these definitions and principles have gradually become
"<i>a body</i>," in which there is an organic arrangement
of parts, all being placed in a just order and mutual interdependence.
There is no old Science, and there can be
no new Science, in which these four conditions do not
meet and become blended; and the beauty of it is, that
this Definition applies to any Science in all stages of its
growth. No one of all the Sciences is as yet completed;
but just so soon as any correct definitions and principles
are drawn from and applied to any <i>class</i> of things clearly
circumscribed as such, and these definitions and principles
are orderly arranged in a <i>body</i>, there is an incipient
Science; and its progress towards perfection will proceed
in precisely the same manner in which its foundations
have been laid; new facts and principles and definitions
will gradually be discovered, and these when reapplied to
the class of things out of which they have sprung, will
lead to corrections and adjustments and enlargements of
the Science; and no matter how far these logical processes
may be carried, the general Definition with which we start
will also be found ample at the end of the journey.</p>

<p>All of the Sciences without exception have been developed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
into their present position in just this manner; and
they fall easily into three great classes, namely, the Exact,
the Physical, and the Moral Sciences. The ground of this
triple classification is partly the distinct subject-matter in
the three classes of Sciences, and partly the distinctive
prominence of one or more of the logical processes of construction
in each.</p>

<p>Thus, the class of the Exact Sciences consists only of
the formal Logic, and pure Mathematics. These two are
distinct from all other sciences, because their logical method
of procedure is wholly Deductive. Deduction is the process
of the mind, by which we pass from a <i>general</i> truth
to a <i>particular</i> case under it, that is to say, from <i>more</i> to
<i>less</i> inclusive propositions. Stuart Mill argues at much
length in his book on Logic, that even the axioms of pure
Mathematics are originally gained by Induction, while
others claim that the truth of these axioms is perceived
<i>intuitively</i>, but no matter how this point is decided, the
construction process of the Pure Mathematics is from the
General to the Particular. So it is also with the Aristotelian
logic, whose Major Premise, whether only <i>supposed</i>
to be true or intuitively <i>perceived</i> or inductively <i>proved</i> is
always General in its terms. This is the form of Aristotle's
Syllogism:&mdash;All sinners deserve to be punished; John is
a sinner; and therefore, John deserves punishment.</p>

<p>Physical Sciences are those concerned with the classifications
and laws of action belonging to material substances.
There are a great circle of these, of which Astronomy,
Botany, and Chemistry, may serve as examples. They
have been mostly developed since the time, and in accordance
with the methods, of Lord Bacon; who, in strong
reaction against the Deductive logic of Aristotle, exalted
Induction or the mode of generalizing from <i>particulars</i>, as
the true way of building up Sciences; and, as the subject-matter
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
of each of the physical sciences is well open to
observation and experiment, to Induction and Deduction,
and to corrective verifications, both inductive and deductive,
the new method proved remarkably pregnant and successful.
Each of these sciences has a distinct <i>Class</i> of objects
or phenomena to which its attention is directed; the class
is circumscribed by the scientific Conception and Definition;
its devotees as a rule are skilled in using the
Baconian tools; and consequently, its conclusions receive
the confidence and control the action of men. All of the
Physical Sciences are constantly enlarging "the body of
exact definitions and sound principles" connected with
their several classes "of facts or phenomena."</p>

<p>Moral Sciences are those concerned with the classifications
and laws of action belonging to beings having
Thoughts and Desires and Will. The most developed of
these sciences at present are Metaphysics, Ethics, and
Economics. Each of these is concerned with a single
class of phenomena, which may be exactly conceived of
and defined, and is open to the logical processes by which
alone Sciences can be built up. But Induction cannot
march up with quite so sure a stride, nor Deduction
descend with so large degrees of certainty, in relation to
<i>persons</i> endowed with free-will, as in relation to physical
substances held firm in the grip of unvaried law. Still,
the doubt always attaches far more to the actions of an
<i>individual</i> than to the actions of the <i>masses</i> of men. It
is much easier to know human nature in general, than one
man in particular, because many Inductions guided by
observation and History make it almost certain how masses
of men will act under a given set of conditions, while any
one <i>may</i> act in a contrary way. Deduction, accordingly,
cannot hold quite the same place in the Moral Sciences
so far as individuals are concerned, as it holds in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
Physical and Exact Sciences; but this lack is perhaps
more than made up by other advantages. <i>Experience</i> in
the moral sciences corresponds to <i>Experiments</i> in the physical
sciences. Then there is the great advantage of <i>Introspection</i>;
since each man has within himself the means of
interpreting and testing the inductions of Metaphysics,
Ethics, and Economics. Then also there is the great
resource of <i>Feigned Cases</i>, which, provided only they be
cases possible to occur, open up to Reasoning a new means
of proving and correcting. Besides these, which it enjoys
in common with them, Economics, as we shall soon see,
possesses one other great advantage over and above the
rest of the Moral Sciences.</p>

<p>Since, then, Political Economy deals primarily with
Persons, and only quite secondarily with Things, it is,
under the definition and on every ground, a "moral science";
yet it must not be confounded in the least with
what is sometimes called the science of Morals, or Ethics.
There is one word that marks and circumscribes the field
of Ethics, and that word is <i>Ought</i>; there is one word also
that marks and circumscribes the field of Economics, and
that word is <i>Value</i>. Now, the idea of <i>obligation</i>, on which
ethical science is founded, and the idea of <i>gainful exchange</i>,
on which economical science is founded, are totally distinct
ideas. The imperatives of ethical obligation rest upon the
consciences of men, and Duty is to be done at all hazards;
guilt is incurred if it be neglected; while pecuniary gains
and losses, however large, do not, or at least ought not,
weigh a feather against an intuition of Right and Wrong.
Economics, on the other hand, does not aspire to place its
feet upon this lofty ethical ground; no man is ever under
any moral obligation to make a trade; he properly makes
it or not, according to his present sense of its gainfulness
to himself; and so economic science finds a solid and adequate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
footing upon the expedient and the useful. Ethics
appeals only to an enlightened conscience, and certain
conduct is approved because it is Right, and for no other
reason; Economics appeals only to an enlightened self-interest,
and exchanges are made because they are mutually
Advantageous, and for no other reason; each of the two
Sciences, therefore, has a basis and sphere of its own, and
the grounds of the two are not only independent, but also
incommensurable.</p>

<p>We will now apply <i>seriatim</i> to Political Economy the
four fundamental conditions belonging to all recognized
Sciences, and so determine for ourselves whether it be
not a strict science, and thus worthy in its leading propositions
of all acceptation.</p>

<p>(a) Every science must have to begin with a definite
Class of facts, which lie in an easily circumscribable field,
and which are not likely to be confounded with other facts
of a differing nature. Economy has such a class of facts,
that lie in such a field, and that cut themselves off by
sharp lines from all other things. <i>Valuables</i> is its class
of things. It has nothing to do with any other class of
things. Its field is Value, or Sales, or Exchanges. This
field is perfectly definite. Sales are never confounded
with gifts, and are never confounded with thefts. They
have a distinctive character of their own. They have
always been in the world, will always be in the world in
ever-multiplying volume, and no one ever mistakes their
main features for anything else. Anything whatsoever
that is salable, or is about to be made so, comes within
the view of Economics, and scientifically it cares for nothing
else. While it finds its field definite, it also finds it
broad. It has no wish to encroach on other sciences, nor
will it tolerate any encroachments on its own. Before
anything is sold, or is being made ready to sell, it cares
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
nothing what other science employs itself upon that thing;
after the thing is sold, Economy loses its interest in it,
and other sciences may take it up if they choose. Valuableness
is the one quality that constitutes the Class of
things with which the Science is conversant, and it claims
complete jurisdiction over all things just so far forth as
they have this one quality, and no farther. Now there <i>is</i>
in the actual world such a Class of things; its exterior
boundaries have been exactly ascertained by a long series
of Inductions and Deductions, tentative, corrective, and
confirmatory; and accordingly, Political Economy has now
in full possession the first grand condition of a Science.</p>

<p>(b) This great class of facts, thus reached by logical
Generalization and grasped and held by a mental Conception
and fixed by an adequate verbal Definition, is
remarkably open to all the logical processes of reasoning,
by which alone sciences are constructed, and thus possesses
in full measure the second grand condition of the Sciences.
Not one logical resource is denied to the economists: all
the tools of the scientific workshop are at their hands.
Let us now catalogue these in their order.</p>

<p>(1) <i>Induction.</i> This is the logical and universal process,
by which the mind naturally passes up from a certain number
of observed cases, in which a certain quality appears,
to a Generalization, which is a conception of the mind followed
by a statement in words to the effect, that <i>all possible
cases</i> of that kind will exhibit the quality already
observed in <i>the few cases</i>. It has as its basis a confidence
in the resemblances and uniformities of Nature; it proceeds
upon the axiom that Nature throughout is consistent
with herself; and this confidence has been ten thousand
times justified in the issue, when it is found that Nature
preordained the Sciences by causing grand analogies to
run through each department of her works, including man
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
and his works. The structure of the human mind corresponds
with these objective resemblances; it seizes upon
them, and delights in them, and naturally and joyfully
infers and concludes that what has been observed of <i>a part</i>
may be safely affirmed of <i>the whole</i> of that kind; accordingly,
the world over, when certain things are found to
be true in a considerable number of cases, the mind leaps
over space and time to a whole class, and frames for itself
a general rule or principle, which binds all the cases into
one bundle, and thereafter confidently affirms what is
known to be true of some to be probably true of all. This
is inductive Generalization; and the strength and the joy
of it is well expressed by Descartes: "<i>I have thought that
I could take as a just generalization that which I very clearly
and vividly conceived to be true.</i>"</p>

<p>Experience in Economics corresponds to Experiment in
the Physical Sciences, and furnishes to Induction all the
fuel it can ask for to feed its logical furnace and to forge
the chains that bind the Cases to the Classes. Personal
experience in buying and selling, local experience in buying
and selling, and national experience in buying and selling,
with all that belongs to these, the records of which
are full to overflowing, afford to the inductive inquirer in
Economics an inexhaustible supply of material. Instances
abound. Particulars may be gathered up one by one on
every hand and linked into the inductive chain. If any
doubt be felt about the strength of any one of these chains,
another one may at once be linked in terms drawn from
another field of Experience with a view to test the strength
of the first. Most fortunate from this point of view is the
United States, because here there are States with substantive
powers of control over most matters of trade within
their borders, as well as a Nation with sovereign powers
of control over some points of trade within the country
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
as a whole. This feature has given birth to commercial
experiments as well as commercial experience of all kinds;
and Induction rejoices in all these abundant materials for
generalization thus furnished free of cost to Science,
though unfortunately not free of cost to the People.</p>

<p>(2) <i>Deduction.</i> This is a logical process exactly the
reverse of the first, in that it descends from a generalized
statement reached by the inductive process to some particular,
or subordinate class of particulars, ostensibly covered
by the general maxim. Induction examines a number of
particulars, and then makes a leap, it may be a long
leap, over all intervening particulars, to its Generalization
clamping them. The main use of Deduction is to make
sure of any one of these overleaped particulars, which may
come into importance, and thus confirm the generalization,
or correct it. It is not strictly true, what is often alleged
against deductive reasoning, that there is nothing <i>new</i> in
its result, that the Induction had already passed through
that particular in rising to its Generalization, and therefore
to descend to any particular link to examine that, is something
useless. The exact truth is, that it <i>is</i> useless to
examine again deductively the very particulars that were
carefully studied inductively, but on the other hand there
is always much actually untraversed territory between
these already examined particulars and the inductive generalization,
and Deduction is often very useful in carrying
us down to questionable points in this territory. Even
Lord Bacon, who scorned the syllogism, admits this:
"<i>Axioms duly and orderly formed from particulars easily
discover the way to new particulars, and thus render sciences
active.</i>"</p>

<p>We will illustrate this by a reference to Franklin's
famous induction to prove the identity of lightning with
electricity. Only one experiment, and that a very rude
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
one, was needful in this case; although usually many
experiments, or the careful observation of many particulars,
are necessary in inductions; but the generalization
having been gained, Deduction had a chance to try its
hand; it had long been observed that electricity could be
conducted from point to point, and if electricity and lightning
be identical, then lightning can be so conducted;
therefore, deduced Franklin, a pointed iron rod elevated
above buildings will harmlessly conduct lightning from
the clouds into the ground. Deduction gave mankind the
lightning-rod, and so made one point of science "<i>active</i>,"
as Bacon phrased it; and it is noticeable, that Turgot's
felicitous epigram turns on the deductive rather than the
inductive side of Franklin's experiment: <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Eripuit c&oelig;lo fulmen
sceptrumque tyrannis.</i></p>

<p>Let us catch up another illustration from the science
of Botany, to show how Deduction may strengthen and
sharpen an inductive result. The botanists say, that
apple-tree blossoms are always five-petaled, because blossoms
from a large number of apple-trees in various localities
have been observed to have just five petals to the
blossom; so far, they affirm inductively, and indeed securely;
but they have also reached by means of another
induction a much broader law of plant-life, namely, that
outside-growers, when they have petaled flowers at all,
always have them five-fold; now apple-trees are outside-growers;
and therefore, deductively also, and conclusively
beyond shadow of question, apple-tree blossoms are five-petaled.</p>

<p>Political Economy is just as open to Deduction as it is
to Induction, and the two continually are reaching each
other the hands of economical reasoning, not always
indeed pursuing each a separate and distinct path to the
end, as in the botanical instance just adduced; because in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
practice the two processes mingle constantly, and neither
is carried out in full and due form, since premises used by
the mind are often dropped in the statement, and shortened
forms of expression take the place of long-drawn-out formulas.
But all good reasoning in Economics, as in all
other sciences, is analyzable into one or other of these two
processes, both based alike on the uniformities of Nature
and the structure of the human mind.</p>

<p>Deduction has not quite the same scope and certainty
in Economics as in the Physical Sciences, because any one
<i>may</i> act contrary to the vastly probable action of many
individuals; still, it is a safe and potent process in economics,
since it may descend securely from the larger masses
to the smaller, even though perchance the individual
escape, because of the simplicity and universality and certainty
of the impulses that lead men to exchange. John
Bascom gives the reason well, why both Induction and
Deduction have so firm a grasp upon this science: "<i>Between
one dollar and two dollars a man has no choice, he
must take the greater; between one day and two days of
labor he must take the less; between the present and the
future he must take the present. This is not a sphere of
caprice, nor scarcely even of liberty; the actions themselves
present no alternative, and, if an alternative giving an opportunity
for choice does arise, it arises from some partial or
individual impulse, from some one of those transitory and
foreign influences, which, while rippling the surface, neither
belong to nor affect the current of the stream.</i>"</p>

<p>(3) <i>Introspection.</i> Everybody buys and sells, and almost
everybody watches the action of his own mind enough
to see what are his <i>motives</i> in buying and selling, and soon
comes to know also that the other party has corresponding
motives. Even the child knows perfectly, that it takes
two to make a bargain, that each party renders something
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
to the other, that each is glad to part with something for
the sake of receiving something from the other, and that
this higher esteem put by each on what is taken from the
other makes for each the gain of the trade. A very little
introspection tells anybody, that were this higher esteem
wanting in the minds of either of the two, the trade would
not take place at all. Everybody within the pale of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">compos
mentis</i> knows, that, were his own desire for the rendering
of another to increase, he himself would offer more of
his own rendering rather than forego the trade; and he
rightly infers, that what is true of himself is true of all
other men; and so, every seller rightly tries to display his
wares in such a way as to increase the desire of buyers for
them; knowing full well from his own experience in buying
that, other things being equal, they will be willing to
render him more for them in consequence.</p>

<p>The phrase above, "rightly infers," is based upon the
truth, that all men are remarkably alike in certain great
departments of action; and that, in no department are
they so nearly alike as in this of buying and selling.
Introspection, therefore, an easy self-knowledge open to
all persons alike, and a personal experience in these matters
that everybody gains, give most trustworthy answers
to Inductive inquiry along these lines. Trade is natural
and gainful, as any person can see, who stops to ask himself
why he has made, or is about to make, a given trade;
and if natural and gainful to <i>him</i>, equally so for precisely
the same reasons to the party of the other part; hence no
law or encouragement is needed to induce any persons to
enter upon traffic; and any law, or artificial obstacle, that
hinders any two persons from trading, who would otherwise
trade, not only interferes with an inalienable right
that belongs to both, but also destroys an inevitable gain
that would otherwise accrue to both. Political economy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
is very fortunate, accordingly, in being able to make its
appeal to the common sense of all men, giving sound
starting-points through self-knowledge possessed by all
men, guiding to safe steps by means of Induction all who
like to generalize and prove, and especially breaking up
current fallacies by asking the potent question, "How
would you like it yourself?"</p>

<p>(4) <i>Feigned Cases.</i> There are two kinds of these, namely,
those which might be realized in actual fact, and those
which never can be so realized. The acute mind of the
Greeks marked in their flexible language a decided difference
between the class of suppositions that might possibly
become facts, and another class of suppositions impossible
to become facts, by developing a distinct form of expression
for each. This distinction must always be borne in mind
by those who use or note in economical discussions the
expedient of Feigned Cases. Reasoning is always legitimate
and often pregnant from suppositions, whenever
these are such as might readily become facts of experience,
because in that case the argument proceeds upon
recognized and inductive resemblances; but otherwise, no
inference at all can be drawn from them, because it is an
universal truth in Nature and in Logic, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ex nihilo nihil fit</i>,
out of nothing nothing can come. In plausible suppositions
impossible to become facts is a nest of logical fallacies,
that need to be watched. A good illustration may be
found in the Monetary Conference at Paris in 1881. Delegates
were there from all the nations of Europe, from the
United States, and even the distant India. Some of these
in their eagerness for a factitious ratio of value between
gold and silver forgot the important distinction now in
hand, and argued of the good results to flow from the
realization of a supposition, <i>which in fact never could be
realized</i>. Mr. Evarts voiced the French and American
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
delegates in this declaration: "<i>Any ratio now or of late in
use by any commercial nation, if adopted by an important
group of states, could be maintained; but the adoption of a
ratio of 15&#189; silver to 1 of gold would accomplish the principal
object with less disturbance in the monetary systems to
be affected by it than any other ratio.</i>" The fallacy in this
passage is in the words, "could be maintained," which are
a supposition, and what is much worse, a supposition contrary
to fact, from which all arguing is nugatory. Why
it is contrary to fact will be seen at length in the following
chapter on Money.</p>

<p>On the other hand, a supposition that may clearly become
a fact is a substantive thing, and logical inferences may be
drawn from it, just as geometrical inferences may be drawn
from a <i>supposed</i> circle: the circle on the page is not a <i>perfect</i>
circle&mdash;no such circle was ever drawn&mdash;but <i>suppose</i>
it perfect, as it might possibly be, and argument becomes
at once valid. Let us take another Monetary Conference
at Paris in 1867 as an illustration: its judgment as voiced
by Mr. Ruggles of New York was taken with logical propriety,
when the great benefits of an international coinage
of gold alone were argued and announced, because, while
that was then a mere conjectural project, it was possible
any day by mutual agreement among the nations to become
a reality. An international coinage of gold is a simple
question of equivalence of <i>weights</i> in the coins of different
countries: an equivalence of <i>values</i> as between gold and
silver coins for any great length of time is neither simple
nor possible.</p>

<p>(5) <i>Results measurable in numbers.</i> The four preceding
logical processes of proof and construction Political Economy
is glad to share with the other Moral Sciences, but this
fifth and last one it has to itself alone, and this is its chief
scientific advantage over them, and is consequently the main
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
reason why it is already more advanced and more symmetrically
developed than any of them. In common with them
it has important subjective elements, such as Desires, Estimates,
and Satisfactions; in marked advantage over them
it has also objective elements, that can be weighed and
measured and even hardened into statistics. Economics
has an ever ready objective test, which mere mental and
ethical and other moral processes never can have from their
very nature. The <i>result</i> of each and of all economic transactions
may be measured by money, and put down in a
ledger, and published to the world in the form of statistics.
An economic blunder, whether in legislation or in private
action, pretty soon proves itself to be such by the lessened
gains of somebody, and these losses can be stated arithmetically;
and similarly, an economic improvement evidences
itself at once by increased gains coming to somebody; while
it may take years and years to work out the results of an
ethical mistake, and even then their amount can only be
guessed at.</p>

<p>Theories in metaphysics can only be tested by the <i>Reason</i>
of men, and reasonable men without apparent bias of motive
take opposite views of Sensations and Intuitions and Volitions;
while theories in economics, which can be even better
tested by the <i>Reason</i>, have an additional and almost immediate
and constantly recurring test through men's pockets
and the tables of the Census. The people indeed sometimes
deceive themselves, and are also too often deceived
by others, in these matters of buying and selling; but it is
none the less of the utmost consequence to this Science,
that all the results of good and bad practice in Economics
work themselves at last into a definite shape, into facts and
figures that cannot lie. It is not, as in Ethics and Metaphysics,
that tendencies and potencies only are ascertained,
but everything speedily drifts into results measurable in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
numbers, which stand out like landmarks against the sky.
It is just for this reason, as both the schools of the Roman
lawyers admitted, namely, that we have in all cases the
Return-Service as the outward expression and measure of
the Desire and Effort of him who renders the service, and
because it makes no difference which of two services exchanged
be regarded as the return-service, that our Science
is reared on the firm ground of objective realities, notwithstanding
the strong subjective elements that have a constant
part in it.</p>

<p>(c) The third condition of a recognized Science is, that
the logical processes appropriate to its class of facts have
been already carefully applied to them and a certain number
of "exact definitions and sound principles" have been
already "educed from and applied to" them. We do not
hesitate a moment to claim, that this condition also is fairly
and fully met by Political Economy, and that this is a "Science"
under the definition from every point of view, and
particularly from this third point of view; and a few examples
will now be given as a specimen merely of the logical
work already achieved in Economics. First, Induction
more or less busy for two thousand years has given at last
an exact and acceptable definition of the Science, and
impliedly an exact description of the class of facts with
which it is conversant, namely, the Science of Sales, or what
is exactly equivalent, the Science of Value; and Deduction
at all points along this slow road has helped to correct and to
broaden successive imperfect inductions, which an inquisitive
and tentative and cautious spirit&mdash;the mainspring of
Constructive Science&mdash;has instituted from time to time.</p>

<p>Second, precisely the same processes often repeated have
ascertained beyond question, that there are only three
classes of Valuables and the exact differences between them,
and that, consequently, only six cases of Value are possible
to happen.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>Third, so many nations at different times in all ages have
lowered the standard of their Money under a misapprehension
of its nature and in a vain hope of profit, and a general
scale of rising prices following each attempt of this
kind having been several times observed and no instance to
the contrary, Economists came by Induction to assert the
proposition, that falling Moneys cause rising Prices; the
proposition stood secure on inductive grounds alone; but
so soon as a perfect definition of Money, namely, a Measure
of Services, had at last been reached both inductively
and deductively, it became at once a safe Deduction from
the definition, that rising Prices must succeed a falling
Measure. Thus assurance became doubly sure.</p>

<p>Fourth, Introspection gives each buyer and seller such
firm possession of <i>his own motive</i> in buying and selling,
that he naturally and inductively concludes on the ground
that men are substantially alike, that the <i>motive is similar</i>
in the party of the other part; each further step of experience
in traffic assures him of this beyond a doubt,&mdash;each
wants to get and does get something from the other of
more consequence to him than what he gives; every
attempted deviation from rectitude in trade so far forth
throws the trader out from opportunity to trade; opportunity
to trade is nothing in the world but <i>a market</i>; a
market is nothing in the world but men with products in
their hands, desiring to buy other products with these;
the more men anywhere with the more products in their
hands of all sorts to buy with, the better market everywhere
for other men (the more the better) with other
products of all kinds to buy with; all the appropriate
logical processes in action and reaction, all the commercial
experience of all men everywhere, and all the true
statistics of traffic ever gathered, do but assure the inductive
assent to one of the best and broadest of all the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
Generalizations in Economics, namely this: <i>A market for
products is products in market.</i></p>

<p>(d) Are the definitions and principles already logically
educed from and applied to the great class of Valuables
orderly arranged in "<i>a body</i>"? This is the only inquiry that
remains, in order to determine whether Political Economy
is already a "Science" in the strictest sense of that term.
It is admitted, that a jumble of even just definitions and
principles do not constitute a science, but only these when
placed in a just order and interdependence. A "body"
implies an organic arrangement of parts. It has been well
said of the human body, that all its parts are reciprocally
means and ends; the same may be said of every living
organic body, whether vegetable or animal; and the same
may be said in the way of analogy of every developed and
recognized Science. All the definitions and propositions
and illustrations in any science should be so arranged, as
to show the mutual relations and reciprocal dependence of
all the parts, and as to display the whole in harmony and
symmetry.</p>

<p>It is as certain as anything in the future can be in science,
that new principles will be discovered in Economics as Time
and Inquiry go on, and that these will find their place
little by little in a fuller and more rounded "body" than
is at present possible; while it is also as certain as anything
in the future of science can be, that the Outline
of economics is already perfectly drawn, that the great
class of Valuables will never be enlarged nor be better
described, that the category of Commodities, Services,
Credits, is completed for all time, and that the analysis
of each act of trade into two Desires and two Efforts and
two Estimates and two Renderings and two Satisfactions
will never yield additional elements. Political Economy
is already a body of exact definitions and sound principles
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
educed from and applied to a single class of facts. This
body will indeed be enlarged by a future and finer scientific
construction, the arrangement and interdependence of
its parts will be better exhibited, the form and filling up
of the Science within the outline already determined is
sure to become more compact, more robust, and more
beautiful, as the decades and centuries go by; while, as
in the human body throughout all the changes of its
growth and mature life, that future body of economic
science in all its stages towards perfection will be but
the continuation and fuller development of the present
"body" of Political Economy.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II.<br />

<small>MATERIAL COMMODITIES.</small></h2>


<p>Valuables fall naturally and exactly into three classes,
Commodities, Services, and Credits. The reasons are obvious
at first glance, why articles falling in the first class
occupied the thoughts and the efforts of men almost exclusively
for the first thousand years of recorded history.
Commodities appealed to the senses of men: they are
visible, tangible, weighable. Some form of personal slavery
existed everywhere, and largely withdrew attention
from personal services bought and sold; and there was
not apparently sufficient personal confidence between man
and man in the earlier ages to allow much development of
credits, whose ground is personal trust and whose sphere is
future time. Commodities, on the other hand, fitted by
the efforts of some men to satisfy the immediate wants of
other men, all ready for delivery, to be exchanged against
other commodities similarly fitted and at hand, took the
field apparently in the earliest ages of recorded Time,
gradually became very large in volume, opened new
routes of travel and transportation, and served to connect
in a rough and ready way neighboring tribes and even
neighboring nations.</p>

<p><i>Commodities are the class of Valuables comprising material
things, organic and inorganic, fitted by human efforts to
satisfy human desires.</i> Cattle were probably among the
first things to become valuable, that is, salable; and it is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
certain, that they became very early in many quarters of
the world a sort of Money or standard of comparison
among other things exchangeable, and indeed they continue
to be such in some quarters to this day. Near the
middle of the sixth book of the Iliad occur these lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Then did the son of Saturn take away<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The judging mind of Glaucus, when he gave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His arms of gold away for arms of brass<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Worn by Tydides Diomed,&mdash;<i>the worth</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Of fivescore oxen for the worth of nine</i>."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Gold and silver also became valuable in the ordinary
way in very early times, and later became Money or a
medium in exchanging other things; and much later other
metals came into use as commodities and then too as
money; for the Latin word for money, <i>pecunia</i>, derived
from <i>pecus</i>, cattle, seems to imply some original equivalence
in value between the bronze stamped with the image
of cattle and the cattle themselves. Parcels of land subdued
and improved by human hands were probably bought
and sold in some portions of the world as early as anything
was,&mdash;at any rate very early. Land-parcels are a commodity
under the definition. Another passage from
Homer, towards the end of the seventh book of the Iliad,
displays some of the commodities in common use during
the heroic age in Greece:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">"But the long-haired Greeks<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bought for themselves their wines; some gave their brass,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And others shining steel; some bought with hides,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And some with steers, and some with slaves, and thus<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Prepared an ample banquet."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The earliest detailed record of a commercial transaction
in commodities, is the purchase by Abraham of the field
and cave in Hebron, more than 2000 years before Christ.
It is narrated at length in Genesis xxiii. Long before
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
this purchase, however, it is said of Abraham that he
"went up out of Egypt very rich in cattle, in silver, and in
gold." This formal sale to him in Hebron of the field and
cave of Machpelah is in all its parts instructive to us, and
full of signs of the drift of those times. It was "<i>in the
audience of the sons of Heth, before all that went in at the
gate of his city, that the field and the cave were made sure
unto him for a possession. And Abraham weighed unto
Ephron the silver which he had named in the audience of
the sons of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, current
money with the merchant.</i>" In the lack of written and
recorded deeds to land-parcels, as we have them now,
the sale of them was "<i>made sure</i>" before the faces of living
men, who would tell the truth and pass on the word.
The market-place in those days was "<i>at the gate of the city</i>,"
where the judges also used to hold their courts, the place
most frequented of all, and sales were made "<i>before all
that went in</i>" thither; "<i>in the audience of the sons of Heth</i>"
was the silver weighed out, and the field made sure in
exchange. Then there were "merchants" as a class;
silver passed by weight rather than by tale, although it
had already passed beyond a mere commodity and had
become money, "<i>current money with the merchant</i>"; and
even at this day the Bank of England takes in and pays out
gold and silver by balance rather than by count, though
they be in coined money: it is the more accurate method.</p>

<p>The author of the book of Job, believed to be of great
antiquity, and certainly true to nature and to fact in
its essential parts, knew very well the modes in which
the ancient mines were wrought, and the worth of the
commodities extracted:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Truly there is a vein for silver,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a place for gold, which men refine.<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>The prophet Ezekiel, who wrote in the sixth century
before Christ, incidentally described in his chapter xxvii
the commerce in commodities, that then centered in the
city of Tyre on the eastern Mediterranean. "<i>All the ships
of the sea with their mariners were in thee to traffic in thy
merchandise: many islands were at hand to thee for trade:
with silver, iron, tin, and lead, they traded in thy fairs:
they brought thee for payment horns of ivory and ebony-wood.</i>"
Among the commodities besides these exchanged
in that market, are mentioned by the prophet horses
and mules and lambs and rams and goats, wine of Helbon
and white wool, fine linen and embroidered work, and
riding cloths and mantles of blue and chests of damask
and thread, wheat and pastry and syrup and oil and balm,
precious spices and cassia and sweet reed, and gold and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
carbuncles and corals and rubies. These old Ph&oelig;nicians
of Tyre colonized Carthage, and thus bore a vast trade in
commodities to the West, going overland into the heart
of Africa for dates and salt and gold-dust and slaves, and
by sea through the Pillars of Hercules northward to the
British Isles for the sake of the trade in tin.</p>

<p>The amount of transactions in commodities, the first
class of Valuables, has been constantly increasing, under
natural impulses which we shall have shortly to describe,
from the dawn of authentic History down to the present
moment; and figures are baffled in expressing to our
minds the sum of these transactions even in a single country,
still more their aggregate in the commercial world.
The foreign trade of every country is almost exclusively
in commodities, and is only a small fraction of its domestic
trade in the same; and so, when we remember that the
foreign trade of the United States, for example, under a
commercial system designed and adapted to curtail such
trade, amounted in 1889 to about $1,600,000,000, and the
foreign trade by Great Britain the same year to about
4,000,000,000, we gain a glimpse, we touch as it were the
hem of the garment, of the gigantic traffic of the world
in commodities alone.</p>

<p><i>The Production of Commodities is the getting them ready
to sell and the selling them.</i></p>

<p>1. We must look first at the <span class="smcap">Requisites</span> of such production.
They are three, <i>Natural Agents</i>, <i>Human Efforts</i>,
<i>Reserved Capital</i>. The following lines of Whittier touch
incidentally on these three requisites, and may serve us as
a general introduction to them:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Speed on the ship!&mdash;But let her bear<br /></span>
<span class="i2">No merchandise of sin,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No groaning cargo of despair<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Her roomy hold within.<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"No Lethean drug for Eastern lands,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">No poison-draught for ours:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But honest fruits of toiling hands,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And Nature's sun and showers!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Natural Agents include not only "Nature's sun and showers,"
but also all the forces and fertilities and materials of
free Nature, that men may and do avail themselves of in
preparing commodities to exchange with the commodities
of other men. Of higher rank in Production than these
natural agencies are the Efforts of men in molding them so
as to answer other men's Desires, of which efforts the "toiling
hands" of the poet are a symbol. They include also the
inventive brains and eloquent tongues and the skilful
manipulations of every name. The poet's "ship" is an
instance of capital, which is always a result of previous toil
reserved to help on some future sales. These three elements,
Nature, Labor, Capital, conspire in all production of
commodities. Nature comes first with her free forces and
materials; and then present toil aided by the results of
past toil in the form of capital does all the rest in getting
commodities ready to sell and selling them. Let us
now note each of these three a little more closely.</p>

<p>(a) Natural Agents. The most important point about
these is, that they are the free gifts of God, and continue so
throughout the complications and transformations wrought
on them and through them by Labor and Capital, until the
material commodity of whatever kind is finally sold, and so
passes out of the purview of our Science. Many of the
gifts of God, like the air we breathe and the light in which
we recreate ourselves and the water of refreshment drunk
from spring or brook, do not connect themselves in any way
with commodities bought and sold, and nobody ever thinks
of them as salable at all; but it has seemed and still seems
to many, as if the natural fertility in a land-parcel, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
water-fall along the course of river or stream, the timber-growth
which the hand of man planted not, the deposit of
gold or coal in the bowels of the earth, and other such-like
cases in which natural gifts <i>do</i> connect themselves with
human services and then are sold, lifted the Value of the
things sold above the point to which the mere human efforts,
whether past or present, would raise it. In point of fact,
this seeming is not a reality, as will fully appear in the
sequel. God is a Giver, and never a Seller; and he has arranged
it so in his great world of gifts, that, however much
shrewd men may try to monopolize these gifts and then
dole them out to other men for pay, they are always practically
thwarted in the attempt. God himself never takes
pay for anything, and has never authorized anybody to
take pay in his behalf; and when this role of Seller of free
gifts, which have cost him nothing and which he has not
improved, is taken up by any one, he is shortly crowded off
the stage in shame by other actors true to Nature.</p>

<p>This is the place for a grand induction. When we study
in detail the free gifts of God to this world and its inhabitants,
we find they come and keep coming <i>in great classes</i>.
This is one of the uniformities of Nature, on whose solid
ground men tread and stride in safe inductive reasoning.
Can a farmer get pay in the price of his grain for the original
fertility of his field, which neither he nor his fathers
nor his neighbors have bettered or made more available?
Doubtless he would be <i>glad</i> to do so, doubtless he <i>would</i> do
so, were it not for the primary fact, that such fertilities as
his are in a <i>class</i> of fields, that other men in more or less
proximity to him raise grain on other fields, whose original
fertility is equal to that in his field; and some of these other
men in common competition with the rest as sellers will be
willing to part with <i>their</i> grain for a price which will be a
fair equivalent for the onerous human services rendered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
in getting their grain ready to sell and selling it; and the
free action of <i>these</i> men as sellers will tend to fix a general
market-rate for grain then and there, at which rate <i>all</i> must
sell whether they will or nill; and where now is the effect
on price of God's free gift? It is still free.</p>

<p>Here is a fine water-fall on the bounding river, the
banks are low at this point, just the place for mill and
factory, the weight of God's free water will turn the
wheels, a hamlet will grow up around them&mdash;perhaps a
city,&mdash;can the riparian owner charge a fancy price for site
of dam and mill? He might under some circumstances;
but the same river doubtless, above, below, rolling over
similar geological strata, leaps and falls at other points
also; there are other owners of mill-privileges within hail;
besides, there are other streams and tributaries in the
region round about; and water has a knack of dropping to
the lower levels. God's gifts are broad in classes; competition
naturally has free play; natural agents are an essential
factor in commodities; so and more so are human
efforts; but Values tend perpetually and powerfully under
natural competition between men as sellers to proportion
themselves to the onerous human efforts involved, and to
eliminate completely from all influence on themselves the
broad and bountiful gifts of Providence.</p>

<p>What has been observed to be true in respect to two or
three or more of the classes of God's free gifts <i>to</i> men, or
<i>in</i> men, may almost certainly be inferred to be true of all
such classes. Therefore, inductively, <i>such free gifts have
no effect on Values to lift them, their influence being eliminated
by human competition</i>. Of course, if there be unique
cases of remarkable gifts, falling in no class, subject consequently
to no competition, one cannot say confidently
that the free element in conjunction with the onerous
element may not make the return-service greater than it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
would be otherwise. It may, or it may not, make it greater.
There is no living principle at work in such cases, that
makes it certain, that the return-service will <i>not</i> be greater.
Still, unique cases, if they exist, are of little or no consequence
in Economics. They are most remarkably few,
at all events. Where come in the solitary gifts, that may
later be connected with Valuables, on the round earth as
God fashioned it? Gold, silver, diamonds, copper, coal,
tin, amber, spice-shrubs, chinchona-trees, and all such
things, have been scattered too widely and liberally for
individuals to monopolize them, or even combinations of
men unless they be assisted by law. Where even are
the unique cases of God-given talent or genius in men
themselves, such as may become connected with Valuables
of the second class? Daniel Webster had his competitors
in the Court-room and in the Senate, Ben Jonson did not
let Shakspeare have it all his own way on the stage, and
even "Milton's starry splendor" did not make Paradise
Lost sell well.</p>

<p>We must just note here in passing the supreme importance
in an economical point of view of untrammelled
competition in the sale of commodities. It is the divinely-appointed
means, and the only possible means, of preventing
wide-spread injustice through Monopoly. Nothing
else in the world can be made effective to estop men from
robbing their fellow-men through exchanges artificially
restricted; from charging more in the market for their
wares than a just compensation for their own efforts;
from enriching themselves by impoverishing their neighbors;
from worsening the quality of their wares offered
for sale; and from relying upon the artificial restrictions
put on their competitors, rather than on their own skill
and enterprise and the goodness of their goods, for a market.
The Common Law of England holds monopolies to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
be illegal, and the reasons given (11 Coke, 84) are, first,
because the price of the commodity will be raised; second,
because the quality of the commodity will not be so good
and merchantable as it was before; and third, because they
are apt to throw many working people out of employment.
It is nothing less than a crime against Civilization, than a
sin against the clear ordinance of God, than an artificial
obstruction to individual and national Progress, to put up
bars and barriers by law for the purpose of cutting off
competition, whether domestic or foreign, either by putting
disabilities in the path of any or through monopoly tariff-taxes,
in the buying and selling of useful commodities
anywhere.</p>

<p>(b) Human Efforts. Every way unlike the free forces
and materials of Nature, indispensable as these are in the
production of commodities, is the second requisite in such
productions, namely, the onerous efforts of men. Persons
are very different from things, from powers, from lifeless
materials. Persons act from motives only. Minds lie
back of bodily exertions, impelling and guiding them.
Such efforts as are needful to mold materials into commodities
are only put forth in view of, and for the sake
of, a remunerative return; and only rational beings, acting
under motives whose goal is in the future, capable of foresight
and of adapting means to ends, can put forth such
efforts. No degree of training can make even the most
intelligent animals capable in any degree of that kind of
exertion, which we call <i>Labor</i>; and there is no improvement
whatever in the methods of animals in reaching their
instinctive ends,&mdash;the beaver builds his dam and the bee
gathers and deposits the honey exactly as bees and beavers
did ages ago.</p>

<p>In the strictest sense, accordingly, there is no such thing
as physical labor, because the mental must coöperate with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
the physical even in the lowest forms of human exertion;
and in the same sense there can be no such thing as exclusively
mental labor, for the bodily powers conspire more
or less in the highest intellectual efforts that are ever sold.
Nevertheless, both the phrases, physical labor and mental
labor, are convenient and not harmful, whenever on the
one side the bodily powers seem to be predominant in the
effort, and on the other the intellectual.</p>

<p>It is now to be noticed, that all that men can do, when
they labor physically, is <i>to move something</i>. When a man
works with his hands or his feet or his whole body, all
that he does or can do, is to begin a series of motions or
resistances to motion, for this good reason, human muscles
in their very structure are capable only of starting motion
and stopping motion. All the marvellous results of physical
effort in all the world have flowed from so simple a
matter as the contraction and expansion of muscle; and
the world of materials is so cunningly constructed, that,
when these are moved into right position by human hands,
or by some form of capital itself the result of previous
human handling, the free powers of Nature do all the rest,
and valuable commodities are the good outcome. For one
example, when the woodman fells a tree for sale, he brings
a series of motions (<i>labor</i>) to bear upon the trunk, by
means of his sharp axe (<i>capital</i>), and then the power of
gravitation (<i>nature</i>) seizes the tree and brings it crashing
to the earth. For a second illustration, wool and cotton
have by nature a certain tenacity of fibre, and what is
more to the point, a certain <i>kinkiness</i> of fibre easily interlinking
one with another indefinitely in length; men move
these separate fibres in certain relations to each other by
an instrument (<i>capital</i>) called a spindle, and the result is
thread; then other men move these threads into relations
with each other by means of an implement (<i>capital</i>) called
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
a shuttle, and the outcome is a web of cloth; lastly, the
tailor moves his shears through the cloth, and then his
needles, and the issue is a coat, a commodity, the valuable
for which all these processes were gone through with, and
by the sale of which all the onerous factors therein are
compensated.</p>

<p>Now, since human muscles are soon wearied in action,
and since motion is the only thing required of men in the
production of commodities, they naturally look around for
outside help in this matter; and the first help they lighted
on for moving things was the domestic animals, the ox and
ass and horse, doubtless domesticated in the very beginnings
of society; and as these can be used in so many
different places, and for such a variety of purposes, and
are so cheaply reared, they are exceedingly useful as a
motive power, and will probably never be superseded as
such. Inanimate auxiliaries in moving things into right
position for the production of commodities, such as the
water-wheel and wind-mill, were undoubtedly brought into
use much later; and much later still, steam and electricity
and other more subtle and recondite natural agents. All
of these helps, whether animate or inanimate, do but cause
simple motions of the same kind as those caused by the
human hand. The most ponderous engine merely reduplicates
that which the arm of a child is capable of; while in
point of delicacy and firmness of touch, perhaps no machinery
can subdivide and apply this motion so skilfully
as the human fingers can. It is said that some of the lace
made wholly by hand is finer and more delicate than any
yet woven by machinery, although the introduction of
machinery into lace-making has cheapened lace products
in general to a small fraction of their former cost.</p>

<p>What we commonly call "<i>Power</i>," then, by whatever
instrumentality furnished, is simple auxiliary motion, additional
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
to that of physical human Labor. Commodities are
produced in unlimited quantity and variety by such labor,
assisted by the free forces of nature applied by means of
animals and implements, which are capital. But such
labor is irksome as well as wearisome, and is never expended
except in view of a reward, which is secured only
from the sale of the finished commodity.</p>

<p>(c) Reserved Capital. We must examine the nature of
Capital with care, and follow its varied forms without confusion,
because it is the only other factor besides labor in
the production of commodities, that has to be paid for out
of their sale.</p>

<p>Simplest cases are always the best in economical discussions.
Let us take for illustration a recently observed
case from the gold hills of North Carolina. All the
methods are strongly primitive, but all the elements of
production are present. A negro woman is the laborer,
the bits of gold scattered in the soil are the free gift of
nature, a bored log to divert the water from the mountain
stream, and a tin pan in which to gather and wash the
sand and gravel, are two crude forms of capital; free
gravitation also brings the water through the log, and free
gravity carries down the particles of gold to the bottom of
the washing-pan, and many other agencies of free nature
coöperate in this very simple case of production; and
besides the log and the pan, there are doubtless some other
forms of capital, at least the whittled plug to stop at need
the flow of water through the log. The chief factor in
these processes of production is still the laborer, the
motions of her hands in stirring the sand and picking out
the precious bits at the bottom of the pan are the chief
motions, the labor is both physical and mental,&mdash;no animal
could be trained to adopt means to ends like this
negro woman.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>It is her capital that now engages our attention. <i>Any
Valuable outside of man himself reserved to assist in the
production of further valuables is Capital.</i> The idea of
growth and increase inheres in the very word, which is
derived from the Latin noun, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">caput</i>, a head, a source, and
gives intimation in its etymology of its scientific meaning.
The word, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">caput</i>, is often used in classical Latin for a sum
of money put out at interest, and its derivative, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">capitale</i>,
is also used in the same sense, at least in mediæval Latin;
and from this form of the word have come into English
not only <i>Capital</i>, but also by corruption <i>Cattle</i> and <i>Chattels</i>.
Flocks and herds were at one time the principal
riches of our Saxon ancestors, and also the principal means
of <i>increasing</i> their riches, and in process of time the same
root-word came to be spelled differently as applied to animate
or inanimate things of value; while the notion
implied in the Latin <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">caput</i>, and in the English <i>source</i>,
came along in all three of these words; and hence the
careful definition of Capital above given.</p>

<p>It makes no difference whether the colored woman
bored her own log by means of an item of capital already
existing, namely, an auger, or hired another person to
bore it for her, or bought the log already perforated, it
is an article of Capital, a valuable kept to increase future
valuables; she might doubtless sell it for something to a
new-comer wishing to operate other sand in the neighborhood,
but she keeps it to help herself gather more gold for
ultimate sale, she practises what we call in Economics
<i>abstinence</i> and must have her reward for this in the form
of <i>profits</i> from the ultimate sale of her commodity, gold,
as well as a reward for her labor in the form of <i>wages</i> from
the same source. As one person furnishes both the labor
and capital in this case, there is no actual division of the
gross return into wages and profits, as there always must
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
be when separate parties furnish the two essential factors,
both of which must be remunerated by the sale of the commodity.
What is thus true of the log, is equally true of
the tin-pan, and even of the plug also, if it be capable of
repeated use and cost something of labor and the help
of a previous item of capital, namely, the jack-knife. Our
negro woman of the South is a small capitalist as well as
a rude laborer, and practises <i>abstinence</i> as well as puts forth
<i>exertion</i>, and consequently is entitled to receive <i>profits</i> as
well as <i>wages</i> in the return she gets for her gold-dust when
she sells it.</p>

<p>We are now beginning to see what the nature of Capital
is, and what the motives are for employing it. In the production
of commodities Capital is always something that
makes easier to the producers the getting ready to sell and
the selling of future commodities. The capital always
spares more or less of onerous and irksome human exertion.
It always mediates between some free force of
Nature and some otherwise more onerous effort of men.
The sole motive to employ capital in any one or in all of
its multitudinous forms from the simplest to the most complex
is to throw off upon the ever-willing shoulders of
Nature some part of the irksome effort that would otherwise
come to the easily-wearied muscles of men. Nature is
"good," to use a commercial term, for all she can be made
to carry of men's work, through implements devised and
machinery contrived to apply, to commodities in every
stage of their transformation and transportation till the
last, the ever-present potencies of this physical world.
These potencies cost nothing. The implements and machinery
cost much in present labor and previously created
capital. The ultimate sale of commodities must make
return for all the forms of capital employed in their production,
in the shape of Profits, the reward of <i>abstinence</i>;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
and for all the forms of direct labor employed in their production,
in the shape of Wages, the reward of personal
<i>effort</i>.</p>

<p>The beaver gnaws down the tree with his teeth from
generation to generation in precisely the same manner;
but man is a being more nobly endowed than the beaver,
and no sooner had he occasion to fell trees, than something
of the nature of an axe suggested itself to his ingenuity.
It is true, that his earliest attempts at axe-making were
probably of the rudest sort, but just as soon as anything
was devised, whether of flint or shell or metal, that rendered
easier the felling of a tree, Capital made a beginning
along that line of obstacles. Our chief interest in studying
the implements of the successive so-called Ages of Stone
and Bronze and Iron, is to witness the increasing degrees of
ingenuity displayed by those pre-historic men. Among
the more gifted races, progress in this direction was perhaps
more rapid than we are wont to think it was, since
Tubal-Cain, the first artificer of record, is said to have
"<i>hammered all kinds of implements out of copper and iron</i>"
(Gen. iv, 22). Lucretius, writing in the century before
the Christian era, put down the following lines in vigorous
Latin, as translated by Mason Good:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Man's earliest arms were fingers, teeth, and nails,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And stones, and fragments from the branching woods;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then copper next; and last, as later traced,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The tyrant iron."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>We are at no loss, then, to explain the origin of Capital
and its motives. Tools are invented and employed for no
other reason than this, that, by means of their help, the
human efforts are lessened relatively to the given satisfactions.
Since it requires tools to make tools, the progress
of this branch of capital must have been relatively slow at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
first; but, since every advance in mechanical contrivance
makes still further advances easier, there is a natural
tendency, which facts abundantly exemplify, to a more
and more rapid progression in the number and perfection
of all implements of production. The same motive that
impelled to the first invention, has impelled to the whole
series of inventions since, and will constantly impel to
further inventions till the end of time. Every step of this
progress gives birth to a larger and still larger proportion of
satisfactions relatively to efforts; marks an increasing control
on the part of man over the powers of Nature; and
gives promise for the time to come of greater advantages
still in both of these directions. The powers of Nature,
such as those which make the grain grow, bring the tree
down, turn the water-wheel, impel the locomotive, and
send the message round the world, all stand ready to slave
in the service of man; but in order to make their aid
available for human purposes, there must be a plough, an
axe, a wheel, an engine, an electric machine; and it is
because capital brings gratuitous natural forces into service,
and the more so as capital progresses, that the Value of
those commodities produced by the aid of capital tends
constantly to decline as compared with those commodities,
in the production of which capital conspires less.</p>

<p>It is already plain, that the class, Capital, is a smaller
and a peculiar sub-class under the great class, Valuables;
nothing can become Capital until it first become a Valuable,
and then be <i>capitalized</i> by a distinct act or intention
on the part of the owner to reserve it in his own hands
as an aid in further production, or transfer it to other
hands to be so used, he meanwhile receiving profits as the
reward of his abstinence; only a <i>transferable</i> valuable,
accordingly, can become Capital in any case, that is to
say, it must be either a Commodity or a Credit, since personal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
services, though they may be sold, cannot be put
over into the hands of another to be used in production,
and therefore cannot become Capital in any case; and the
chief peculiarity of this sub-class, Capital, is, unlike the
three great classes of Valuables, each of which is utterly
distinct from the other two, so that a Commodity can
never become a Credit or a personal Service either of the
others, that Capital as a class has extremely flexible limits,
and consequently certain Commodities and Credits may
easily enough be Capital to-day, and fall back to-morrow
into their respective classes of mere Valuables and the
next day come out from the class Non-Capital into the
class Capital again. The same commodities and credits
may be capital at one time, and non-capital at another,
though they must be valuable all the time, or cease to be
commodities and credits. When it is said that a young
man's talents and skill are his "capital," the word of
course is used in a metaphorical sense, and the meaning is,
that skill and talents are <i>like</i> capital in some respects.
Popular language is not scientific.</p>

<p>Cicero wrote long ago: "<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Optimum et in privatis familiis
et in republica vectigal est parsimonia</span>." <i>Abstinence is the
best means of revenue as well in private families as in the
State.</i> The source of Capital in a distinct act of will saving
or sparing from present use (<i>parsimonia</i>) a valuable commodity
or credit, and the quick nature of Capital as adding
to itself (<i>vectigal</i>) in profits, are both brought out in this
Latin maxim, which is rather an expression of an old and
ingrained Roman sentiment than anything original with
Cicero. It is the very nature as well as the very name of
"Capital" to increase itself by rapid increments. It is as
well the Stream as the Source. For example, any sum of
money soon doubles itself when put out at compound
interest, because the original sum increases day and night
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
until it be repaid. It is of the essence of every form of
Capital <i>to make growth</i>, because its sole purpose as such is
to become an aid to future and further production. A
trowel in the hands of a mason, which is capital, pays for
itself every day he works with it, and perhaps every hour
of the day, in the increased production wrought by means
of it. The wheel, which free water turns, though a costly
implement, repays that cost a hundred fold in the additional
bushels of wheat turned into flour through its aid as
capital. So of all implements. So of all machinery. So of
all means of transportation: ships, canals, railroads.</p>

<p>There was a strange prejudice in ancient and mediæval
times against this natural increase of capital out of its own
bowels, as it were, owing probably to this dictum of
Aristotle: "<i>For usury is most reasonably detested, as the
increase of our fortune arises from the money itself, and not
by employing it for the purpose for which it was intended.</i>"
In 1360, a French bishop, Nicole Oresme, repeats the error
of Aristotle under the same rhetorical image: "<i>It is monstrous
and contrary to Nature that a barren stock should give
birth, that a thing sterile in its whole being should fructify
and be multiplied from itself, and such a thing is money.</i>"
Even Shakspeare catches up the old figure: "<i>Is your gold
and silver ewes and rams?</i>" Shylock answers: "<i>I cannot
tell; I make it breed as fast.</i>" In the light of the three
requisites of Production, in the light of the purpose and
wisdom of God in arranging the active forces of this
world, the prejudice in question disappears, and intelligence
rejoices in the ever-increasing use of Capital as the
handmaid of Labor, in the quick and sure reward of him
who practises abstinence, in the production of commodities
constantly made easier and cheaper in all directions, in a
scale of comforts for the masses of men assuredly rising, in
a divinely appointed force lifting like Christianity itself
upon the otherwise sagging condition of mankind.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>Capital assumes but two economical forms, namely,
Circulating Capital and Fixed Capital. <i>Circulating Capital
is all those capitalized products, whether commodities or
credits, the returns for the sale or use of which are derived
at once and once for all.</i> All circulating capital will be
found in one or other of the following sub-forms: (1) raw
materials; (2) wages paid out in view of an ultimate
profit; (3) completed products on hand for sale; and
(4) products bought and held for the sake of resale. The
crucial test of circulating capital is the question, Are the
returns to be secured by the single use or single transfer of
that particular product? Tools, for example, in the hands
of him who has manufactured them for sale is circulating
capital. <i>Fixed Capital is all those capitalized products,
which are purchased or held with a view of deriving an
income from their delayed and repeated use.</i> All fixed
capital will probably be found in one or other of the
sub-forms following: (1) tools and machinery in use;
(2) buildings used for productive purposes; (3) permanent
improvements in land parcels; (4) investments in aid of
locomotion and transportation; (5) products rented or
retained for that purpose; and (6) the national money
considered as a whole.</p>

<p>2. We will next look at the essential <span class="smcap">Conditions</span> of the
production of Commodities. These are also three, as are
the Requisites, namely, <i>Association</i>, <i>Invention</i>, <i>Freedom</i>.
More or less will men make and sell to one another
commodities in any state of society, in which there is
permitted any considerable degree of association of men
with men locally or commercially, in which is encouraged
in any way the universal spirit of invention or the desire to
get hard things done easier, and in which some degree of
liberty of action and security of property and equality of
privileges is guaranteed; but it is very plain, that the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
production of commodities will increase in all directions and
become the greatest in that age and country when and
where are allowed the closest ties of human association
both in place and in commerce, the freest scope and largest
rewards of inventive genius, and the highest possible degree
of liberty and security and equality of rights. Let us
illustrate from a state of things in the southern half of the
United States during the first half of the nineteenth
century. For the most part the land owners lived on
isolated plantations widely separate from one another, these
plantations were cultivated by gangs of slaves, a system
that tends to bring all manual labor into contempt, the poor
whites scattered in hamlets felt themselves above the slaves
and beneath the masters, intercourse between the three
classes was little, opportunity to better essentially their
condition was denied to all three alike, there were but few
cities sprinkled over the vast territory and these relatively
small, the only commodity produced on a large scale was
raw cotton, the simple device for ginning this had been
invented in the decade preceding by a college boy from
Connecticut, the agricultural implements were of the rudest
kind, even the coarse shoes for the slaves were bought
at the North;&mdash;in short, the degree of association and
invention and freedom was each so low, that the production
of commodities was exceedingly small, even as compared
with what that production became in one quarter of a
century after the abolition of slavery.</p>

<p>(a) Association. If we may continue for purpose of
illustration our childhood trust in the story of De Foe,
Robinson Crusoe came to lead a very tolerable life upon
his desolate island by means of his own industry directed
so as to satisfy his own wants by his own efforts. He did
everything for himself, and had no opportunity to buy
anything or sell anything. The whole course of such an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
isolated life could never develop the idea of Value, would
require no such word as Commodities or suggest their
production, and such a man while solitary upon his island
could not possess Property in the true sense of that word.
Association is the first main condition of Production,
because of the natural obstacles interposed between the
isolated man and the supply of his various wants. If any
one man try to surmount a considerable number of these
natural obstacles, he must miserably fail, because his
powers are not adequate to the task; and hence it follows,
that, in a state of isolation, <i>men's wants exceed their powers</i>;
but now let the same man devote himself to overcome a
single class of obstacles, for instance, those in the way of
procuring suitable clothing, and his powers are adequate
to this, he soon acquires skill in it, he learns to avail himself
of the free help of Nature and the facilitating processes
of art, he is able to realize large products along his
line, and is now ready to offer his surplus in exchange
with other men, who meanwhile have been giving themselves
each to another class of obstacles, have concentrated
efforts and skill upon them, have succeeded by
the help of Nature and art in surmounting them, and
are now ready to offer their surplus commodities in exchange
for others; and, the exchanges beginning to be
made in all directions, men find that they thus obtain
vastly greater satisfactions for their various desires than
they could possibly get by direct efforts: so that we may
even say, that, in a state of society through association,
<i>men's powers tend to overtake their wants</i>.</p>

<p>Without association with his fellow-men, there is no
creature so helpless, so unable to reach his true end, as is
man; and therefore it is, that the impulse to association
is one of the strongest of our natural impulses. Men come
together, as it were by instinct, into society; and, thus
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
associating themselves together, it is soon discovered, not
only that there are various desires in the different members
of the community, which are now readily met by
coöperation and mutual exchange, but also that there are
very different powers in the different individuals in relation
to those obstacles which are to be surmounted. The
tastes and aptitudes of different men are very diverse.
There is a great diversity in natural gifts. One man has
physical strength, another mechanical ingenuity, a third a
philosophical turn, and a fourth a bent and genius for
traffic. Now, then, Nature speaks in as loud a voice as
she can utter, in favor of such a degree of association and
exchange as shall allow a free development of these varying
capacities, while they work upon the obstacles to the
gratification of men's wants, which lie appropriately
opposite to them.</p>

<p>Men must come together either locally or commercially,
must learn each other's wants, must compare with each
other powers and tastes and opportunities, must come to
have some confidence in each other, and then they will
begin by rendering mutual services back and forth to experience
the better satisfactions and the new strength that
exchanges bring. Whatever improves the character of
men, and thus leads to greater confidence among them,
will enlarge their commerce, and knit closer and wider
ties of association and production. Neighborhood associations
and productions soon create a surplus to be exchanged
for something else with other neighborhoods;
parts of single nations however remote from each other
find a relative diversity of advantage and an increasing
profit in connecting themselves by the ties of trade; and
the separate nations learn, though late, that they are only
one great family for the grand ends of production and progress.
Even within the single nation, there is a strong
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
tendency for particular trades to localize themselves in one
spot, as for instance, the manufacture of skin gloves has
centered itself for the United States in Gloversville,
N. Y.; and so in the great cities that are centres of distribution,
for example, the wholesale grocers of St. Paul
are on one street, the dry goods houses of Boston are in
close proximity, and the booksellers of New York are
tending towards each other in place.</p>

<p>Now, this broad association as between persons and
nations, instead of detracting at all from the individuality
and power of each, is the very thing that brings out the
individuality and intensifies the power of each; because it
is only thus that full scope is given to the exercise and
development of each peculiar power whether of the individual
or the nation. Hence the strong tendency everywhere
visible in the world of commerce towards Specialties:
the old single trades and vocations and professions are
constantly breaking themselves up into parts, and each
man is taking up that for which he is naturally best fitted
and has specially trained himself, and all to the great
advantage of individuality and personal power and progress.
Mr. Carey is certainly right in his principle (much
insisted on in all his books), that the degree of individuality
depends on the degree of association, each advancing
hand in hand with the other; and he is as certainly wrong
in lacking confidence in the natural forces at work tending
to the highest degree of association and consequently to
the highest degree of individuality. These forces are
immensely strong. Men come together as it were by
instinct, being conscious of individual feebleness; personal
interest is soon seen to follow the bent of social attraction;
a just sense of personal dignity and importance in
being a substantive part in the ongoings of society enormously
strengthens the impulse to association and individuality;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
the progress of each and all in achievement and
elevation still further knits the ties of union; and lastly,
a strong feeling of social justice, of what is <i>due</i> to others
as well as to one's self,&mdash;that every man has an inalienable
right to his full <i>opportunity</i> and all that that implies,
to buy and sell and get gain, to life and liberty and the
pursuit of happiness. When motives and powers and
potencies such as these, proven to be universal by broad
and constant inductions, fail as economical forces to secure
association and individuality, then it will be time to look
around with Mr. Carey for some inferior and factitious
force.</p>

<p>(b) Invention. This is the second main condition in
the production of commodities; because production is processes,
getting something ready to sell and selling it; and
Nature stands ever ready with her free agencies to facilitate
these processes, just so far as the inventive brain of
man can contrive to unite the two. Invention is the marriage
of a gratuitous force to an onerous process, and the
fruit of that union is an easier way and multiplied utilities.
There are some in every considerable community, and
more in every community enlarged by the natural association
but just now described, who have the knack of contrivance,
who find their joy in finding a new power in
Nature or some new application of an old power; were it
not for unhindered association and free exchange, the
individuality of these would be effectually repressed, and
they would have to drudge for their daily bread; but the
importance of inventors is well understood in every progressive
community, and under advanced exchanges their
livelihood is guaranteed by those who hope to profit by its
results while their work is maturing; and Production
rejoices and grows strong and throws out unnumbered
hands to make instant use of the new power and the easier
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
processes, in order to multiply commodities in number and
variety.</p>

<p>As an illustration of all this, the reader will be interested
in a brief account of the series of Inventions made
in Great Britain during the last third of the eighteenth
century, in consequence of which the Cotton Industry was
established in that country in such preëminence as has to
this day baffled the attempts of all other countries even to
approximate it.</p>

<p>We catch our first glimpse of Cotton in the pages of
Herodotus, who wrote more than 400 years B.C. in relation
to India as follows: "<i>There are trees, which grow wild
there, the fruit whereof is a wool exceeding in beauty and
goodness that of sheep. The natives make their clothes of
this tree-wool.</i>" This passage is interesting, as showing
that the first comparison of cotton with wool exhibited
their resemblance in whiteness and in <i>kinkiness</i>, which
latter quality enables them both to be spun into yarn; as
showing also, that the Hindoos very early both spun and
wove cotton, and then made it into clothes; and as showing
lastly, the appropriateness of the original name given
to cotton in Europe, namely, "tree-wool," a name by
which the Germans still designate it (Baumwolle). If
the extreme East furnishes the first notice of cotton, the
extreme West follows it next in order. When the Spaniards
discovered Central and Southern America in the first
quarter of the sixteenth century, they reported that they
found the Mexicans clothed in cotton cloth.</p>

<p>But wool was the staple of England. Parliament and
people were jealous of cotton, lest it might prove a rival
to wool, and actually prohibited the introduction of
printed calicoes (so called from Calicut in India whence
they were exported). The taste, however, for calicoes
increased in spite of the prohibition, which was afterwards
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
intermitted for a revenue duty on plain cotton, which was
then rudely printed on blocks in London, Manchester,
and elsewhere; but the prohibition of Parliament against
wearing printed calicoes was first repealed in 1736. Fifteen
years later the United Kingdom imported only 2,976,610
lbs. of raw cotton, and exported only £45,986 of
cotton goods; in one century the import of cotton became
500 times larger than that, and the export of cottons 1300
times larger than that; and this prodigious result was due
mainly to three or four inventions occurring within short
times of each other, by means of which the free forces of
nature took the place of the onerous efforts of men.</p>

<p>John Hargreaves, a poor weaver in the neighborhood of
Blackburn in Lancashire, was returning home from a long
walk, in which he had been purchasing a further supply
of yarn for his own loom. Spinning at that time only
admitted of one thread spun at a time by one pair of
hands, one of which turned the wheel and thus made the
single spindle rapidly revolve, and the other hand pulled
gently upon the "roving" attached to the spindle and
thus drew it out to the requisite tenuity twisted into yarn.
The "carding," then effected by rude instruments called
hand-cards, by means of which the fibres of the cotton
were disentangled and straightened and laid parallel with
each other; and the "roving," a process by which the
short fleecy rolls stripped off the hand-cards were applied
to the spindle and made into thick threads only slightly
twisted, were the two preparatory operations for the
spinning. All these operations were slow and clumsy,
and the consequent expensiveness of the yarn formed a
great obstacle to the establishment of the cotton manufacture
in England. The improvements made in the loom
of that period by Kay, father and son, had shortly before
doubled the power of each weaver, and the spinners could
not keep up in furnishing material to the weavers.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>As Hargreaves entered his cottage from this excursion
to get yarn to keep his loom agoing, his wife, Jenny, accidentally
upset the spindle, which, as was her wont, she
was diligently using. Her husband noticed that the spindle,
which was now thrown into an upright position,
continued to revolve just as when horizontal, and that the
thread was still spinning in his wife's hands. The idea
immediately occurred to him, that it might be possible to
connect a considerable number of upright spindles with
the revolutions of one wheel, and thus multiply the power
of each spinster. "<i>He contrived a frame in one part of
which he placed eight rovings in a row, and in another part
a row of eight spindles. The rovings, when extended to the
spindles, passed between two horizontal bars of wood, forming
a clasp which opened and shut somewhat like a parallel ruler.
When pressed together this clasp held the threads fast; a
certain portion of roving being extended from the spindles to
the wooden clasp, the clasp was closed, and was then drawn
along the horizontal frame to a considerable distance from
the spindles, by which the threads were lengthened out and
reduced to the proper tenuity; this was done with the spinner's
left hand, and his right hand at the same time turned
a wheel which caused the spindles to revolve rapidly, and
thus the roving was spun into yarn. By returning the clasp
to its first situation and letting down a piercer wire the yarn
was wound upon the spindle.</i>"</p>

<p>The powers of Hargreaves' machine soon became known
among his ignorant neighbors, notwithstanding his strenuous
efforts to keep his admirable invention a secret, and
these neighbors naturally enough concluded that a contrivance,
which enabled one spinster to do the work of
eight, would throw many people out of employment. A
mob broke into his house and destroyed his machine.
Hargreaves retired in disgust to Nottingham, where by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
means of the friendly assistance of one other person he was
enabled to take out a patent for his invention, which he
called in compliment to his industrious wife the "<i>Spinning-Jenny</i>."
This invention gave a new impulse to the
cotton manufacture, but had it been unaccompanied by
other improvements, no purely cotton goods could have
been made in England; because the yarn spun by the new
jenny, like that previously spun by hand, was not fine
enough nor hard enough to be used as warp, and linen or
woollen threads had consequently to be employed for that
purpose.</p>

<p>In the very year, however, in which John Hargreaves,
the poor weaver, migrated to Nottingham, Richard Arkwright,
a poor barber's assistant, took out a patent for his
still more celebrated machine for spinning by rollers. In
one respect Arkwright was much worse off than Hargreaves:
the latter had a helpmate meet for him, the former
had a wife who is said to have destroyed the models her
husband had made and to have opposed him in every step
of his career. But Arkwright was not deterred from his
life pursuit by the poverty of his circumstances or the
scandalous conduct of his wife. After many years of
intense and opposed devotion to the possible application
of a simple principle he had conceived in his mind, namely,
that of spinning by means of rollers revolving at varying
rates of rapidity, he succeeded in contriving and patenting
his memorable machine, which, more than any other one
invention, localized and concentrated in England the
gigantic cotton-industry of the world. Arkwright's idea
and achievement was to pass the coarse thread drawn out
from the rovings over two pairs of rollers in succession,
the first of which revolving slowly fined the thread down
evenly and gradually, and then this thread was passed over
a second pair of rollers turning with a high velocity and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
drawing out the line into any requisite tenuity. Thus a
cotton thread was spun capable of being used as warp.
Cotton cloth as such could now be manufactured in
England.</p>

<p>From the circumstance that the mill, at which Arkwright's
machinery was first erected, was driven by water
power, the machine received the inappropriate name of
the "water-frame"; and the thread spun on these rollers
was commonly called the "water-twist." The old mode
of carding the cotton by hand now furnished the "rovings"
too slowly to meet the wants of the new spinning-jenny
and the new water-frame; and these great inventions would
consequently have proven comparatively useless, had not
a more efficient and rapid process of carding the cotton
superseded just at the right time the old system of hand-carding.
Lewis Paul introduced revolving cylinders for
carding the raw cotton into rovings preparatory to spinning,
in partial imitation perhaps of Arkwright's principle
of spinning the rovings by the rotatory motion of rollers.
Paul's machine consisted "<i>of a horizontal cylinder, covered
in its whole circumference with parallel rows of cards with
intervening spaces, and turned by a handle. Under the
cylinder was a concave frame, lined internally with cards
exactly fitting the lower half of the cylinder, so that when
the handle was turned, the cards of the cylinder and of the
concave frame worked against each other and carded the wool.
The cardings were of course only of the length of the cylinder,
but an ingenious apparatus was attached for making them
into a perpetual carding. Each length was placed on a flat
broad riband, which was extended between two short cylinders,
and which wound upon one cylinder as it unwound
from the other.</i>"</p>

<p>While the foregoing series of inventions placed an
almost unlimited supply of cotton yarn at the disposal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
of the weaver, the machinery as yet introduced was still
incapable of providing yarn fit for the finest grades of
cotton cloth. The "water-frame" indeed spun abundant
twist for warps, but it could not furnish the finest qualities
of yarn, because these were too tenuous to bear safely
the pull of the rollers while they wound themselves on the
bobbin. Samuel Crompton, a young weaver living near
Bolton, possessed the ingenuity needful to remove this
difficulty. He succeeded in combining in one machine,
which from its nature is happily called the "mule," the
several excellences of Hargreaves' spinning-jenny and
Arkwright's water-frame. Copying after the latter, the
mule has a system of rollers to reduce the roving; copying
after the former it has spindles without bobbins to
give the twist; and the thread is stretched and spun at
the same time by the spindles after the rollers have ceased
to give out the rove. "<i>The distinguishing feature of the
mule is that the spindles, instead of being stationary, as in
both the other machines, are placed on a movable carriage
which is wheeled out to the distance of fifty-four or fifty-six
inches from the roller beam, in order to stretch and twist the
thread, and wheeled in again to wind it on the spindles. In
the jenny, the clasp which held the rovings was drawn back
by the hand from the spindles; in the mule, on the contrary,
the spindles recede from the clasp, or from the roller-beam
which acts as a clasp. The rollers of the mule draw out the
roving much less than those of the water-frame, and they act
like the clasp of the jenny by stopping and holding fast the
rove, after a certain quantity has been given out, whilst the
spindles continue to recede for a short distance farther, so
that the draught of the thread is in part made by the receding
of the spindles. By this arrangement, comprising the
advantages both of the roller and the spindles, the thread is
stretched now gently and equably, and a much finer quality
of yarn can therefore be produced.</i>"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>The ingenuity of Hargreaves, Arkwright, and Crompton
had been exercised to provide the weaver with yarn,
and had now indeed provided him with more yarn than he
could use; the spinster had beaten the weaver, just as the
weaver had previously beaten the spinster; and the making
of cotton cloth seemed likely to continue sluggish,
because the yarn could not be woven any faster than a
skilled workman could weave it with Kay's improved fly-shuttle.
In the summer of 1784, a Kentish clergyman
named Edmund Cartwright, being in conversation with
some Manchester gentlemen, one of whom observed that,
"as soon as Arkwright's patent expired so many mills
would be erected and so much cotton spun that hands
would never be found to weave it," replied, "Arkwright
must then set his wits to work to invent a weaving-mill."
Notwithstanding the unanimous opinion expressed by the
Manchester gentlemen, that such a weaving-machine was
wholly impracticable, the clergyman himself within three
years had invented and brought into successful operation
the "<i>power-loom</i>." Subsequent inventors improved the
idea which Cartwright originated, and before 1834 there
were not less than 100,000 power-looms at work in Great
Britain alone.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>Substantially the same machinery invented for carding
and spinning and weaving cotton was very shortly and
successfully applied to the carding and spinning and
weaving of wool, because the wisdom of Nature imparted
to them both the same sort of tenacity of fibre, the same
capacity in that fibre to be spun into a thread of indefinite
length by means of the little loops or kinks easily interlocking
contiguous fibres into a single thread, which two
obvious resemblances gave an identical name to the animal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
and vegetable products otherwise so different from each
other.</p>

<p>The spirit of Invention, one of the chief conditions in
the production of material commodities, thus simply illustrated
along the line of a single manufacture, may serve
us for a sample of similar improvements taken and taking
place in scores upon scores of other lines of effort and
production. The principle is the same in all cases past
and present and still to come, namely this, to throw the
strain from the mind and muscles of men upon the forces
and agencies of free Nature, with which the world around
us is crowded in our behalf, and which are waiting to
slave in the service of mankind without rest and without
fatigue,&mdash;without money and without price.</p>

<p>(c) Freedom. By far the most important of all the
conditions, under which the production of material commodities
goes broadly forward, is liberty of action on the
part of the individual; because, wherever such liberty is
conceded, association and invention and all other needful
conditions follow right along by laws of natural sequence.
By liberty of individual action is meant the practical right
of every man to employ his own efforts for the satisfaction
of his own wants in his own way, whether directly or
through exchange. Each man's right of individual freedom
is limited of course by every other man's right to
equal freedom, which the first man is not at liberty to
infringe; and also, in certain few and limited respects, by
what is sometimes called the "general good," the judge of
the application of which must be the government under
which the man lives. With these limitations, which are
few in number and never serious in degree when rightly
applied, and which limit in common all other rights whatsoever,
the right of every man to buy and sell and get
gain is just as fully a right as the right of breathing. It
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
stands on the same impregnable ground. It is a natural
and self-evident and inalienable right, with which each
man has been endowed by his Creator, to put forth efforts
for his own well-being and for those dependent upon him,
either directly or by means of efforts exchanged with other
men equally free; and he is a slave in spirit and position,
who tamely submits to have his own rights of buying and
selling curtailed, or to stand by and see the rights of his
fellow-citizens similarly curtailed, unless such act of interference
and curtailment on the part of his Government be
justified by a solid proof that some other public or private
rights, which are at least as well based as his own, would
be endangered by the exercise of his own.</p>

<p>In what cases may a Government properly step in to regulate
or prohibit the buying and selling of its citizens?
Hundreds of inductions extending through hundreds of
years have been carefully and logically conducted in order
to reach a just and comprehensive answer to this question;
and in all probability the cases have been inductively
ascertained for all time, and they are these: <i>such buying
and selling may be controlled and prohibited, as are proven
to be contrary</i> (1) <i>to the public Morals</i>, (2) <i>to the public
Health</i>, (3) <i>to the public Revenue</i>. All other buying and
selling may be safely assumed to be both profitable to the
parties to it, and also useful to the Commonwealth in
general; and any interference with it by public authority
is a high-handed infringement of natural rights, a blow
aimed at the life and source of property. These wrongful
strokes at private rights, this restriction on the freedom
of individuals to exchange products for their own
welfare, is now mostly confined in civilized countries to
the region of Taxation. Within this region the wrongs
are still frightful. Judge Cooley, in his "Principles of
Constitutional Law," states the matter as follows: "<i>Constitutionally</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
<i>a tax can have no other basis than the raising
of revenue for public purposes; and whatever governmental
action has not this basis is tyrannical and unlawful. A tax
on imports, therefore, the purpose of which is not to raise a
revenue, but to discourage and indirectly prohibit some particular
import for the sake of some home manufacturer, may
well be questioned as being merely colorable, and therefore
not warranted by constitutional principle.</i>"</p>

<p>Formerly, governments interfered almost beyond belief
with the freedom of their people in all industrial and commercial
action; dictating what should and what should not
be grown and manufactured, what should and what should
not be exported and imported; decreeing by proclamation
or enacting by statute, the number of apprentices each
artisan might employ, and the years during which these
must serve as such, and the conditions under which they
might then work as journeymen; the materials to be used
in woven fabrics, and even the widths and other minor
features of such fabrics, were prescribed in the foremost of
the European nations; in the reign of St. Louis of France,
a "Book of Trades" was issued under royal authority and
is still extant, which organizes minutely and subjects to
cumbersome rules more than one hundred separate industries
as then practised; England was the country of the
great trading "Companies," and of all of these the same
may be said as Adam Smith said of the Turkey Company
formed in 1579, namely, it was "a strict and oppressive
monopoly"; among others there were the African Company
established in 1530, the Russia Company beginning
its operations in 1553, the East India Company chartered
on the very last day of the seventeenth century and going
out of existence in our own time, and the Hudson's Bay
Company, chartered in 1670 and so having the sole control
in trade of a region forty times larger than all England;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
while the colonial system prevailing for two centuries in
all the countries of Western Europe regulated the commerce
and controlled the manufactures in the colonies
with a single eye to the benefits of the mother country, as
those were conceived of under the wretched Mercantile
system.</p>

<p>Happily, since governments have become more enlightened
than formerly, they are perceiving for the most part
that they have not the least right to interfere in those ways
or in any ways with the natural right of their people to
make and grow freely all material commodities, and to buy
and sell these freely in the best markets wherever these
markets are to be found; and they are also perceiving,
that by such interference incalculable losses of property
and indefinite retardations of progress are caused to their
people, as well as weakness to themselves as governments
through a more difficult gathering of taxes and a harder
maintenance of prestige and power.</p>

<p>The only motive to a mutual exchange of services,
whether in one or in all of their three kinds, that is to
say, to a free production of commodities and services and
credits, is always and everywhere the mutual benefit of
the two parties exchanging. After all the processes have
been gone through with and the exchanges are consummated,
all the parties are richer than before, that is, they
have more <i>satisfactions</i>, otherwise the processes and exchanges
would instantly cease. Therefore, a universally
free production benefits everybody, and harms nobody.
Moreover, under a system of free production, every man
is allowed under the stimulus of self-interest to work away
at those obstacles to the gratification of human desires
which he feels himself best able to overcome, to follow the
bent of his own mind, and to avail himself of all those
free helps in his peculiar work which Nature offers to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
him. Under these circumstances, obstacles give way in all
directions; the amount of material products produced is
vastly augmented, the number and variety and excellence
of personal services proffered are indefinitely increased,
and credits compelling the Future to pay tribute to production
are multiplied; the diversified and rapidly increasing
desires of all persons in such a community are readily
met through profitable exchanges; while all peculiar facilities
natural and acquired are taken immediate advantage
of, the diversities of relative advantage in production
become marked in all directions, and a new day of industrial
and commercial prosperity is ushered in. Because
under freedom all men are sure to dispose of their industrial
efforts to the best advantage, they have the strongest
possible motives to put them forth; since they can purchase
with them what they will and when they will, and where
they will. Thus freedom leads to extended association,
and also to the invention of machinery and all labor-saving
appliances.</p>

<p>3. We are now in position to understand thoroughly
the ultimate <span class="smcap">Grounds</span> of the production of material commodities.
We have seen, that these commodities have
been multiplying in number and variety and excellence
ever since the beginnings of history, that they are everywhere
multiplying now at a rate hitherto unprecedented
and undreamed of, and that improved and improving
methods of transportation by land and sea are now carrying
these back and forth to the ends of the earth. What
is the <i>principle</i>, under which these things have been done,
are now being done, and are certain to be done in the time
to come?</p>

<p>The physical and moral obstacles, that Nature has
interposed to the gratification of the multitudinous and
constantly increasing desires of men, are so great in all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
directions, that the powers of the individual man are
utterly unable to surmount any considerable number of
them; while at the same time, the physical and moral
powers, adapted under sufficient motives to overcome
these obstacles, are very diverse in the different individuals
of mankind. Not only is there a surprising diversity
in original gifts, but also the powers acquired by gradual
concentration of personal effort upon one set of obstacles
become exceedingly diverse, as does moreover familiarity
in the use of the gratuitous forces of nature which lend
their aid towards overcoming these particular obstacles.
As the result of one or two or all of these, one man
naturally comes to have a vast advantage over others in
his particular branch of business, whatever that may be;
each of these others by precisely the same means comes
to have a legitimate advantage over the first in his own
branch of effort, whatever that may be; and if, as always
happens practically, the first has desires which the varied
efforts of the others can satisfy, and they too desires
which his efforts can satisfy, nothing more is necessary to
profitable exchanges between them than this diversity of
relative advantage at different points.</p>

<p>It is solely because a given effort irksome in itself put
forth for another person, in view of and for the sake of a
return-service from him, realizes more of satisfaction to
both parties than when put forth for one's self directly,
that commercial exchanges ever take place among men.
The sole ground of these, the principle underlying them
everywhere, is <span class="smcap">Diversity of Advantage between different
Men and between different Nations in
different respects</span>. All exchanges whatsoever depend
on diversity of relative advantage in the production of
commodities or services or credits as between the persons
exchanging; and this diversity of relative advantage exists
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
by God's appointment primarily among individual men as
such, and only secondarily on the ground of the varied
soil and climate and position and natural gifts of different
parts of the earth. Reserving these secondary considerations,
which are quite secondary in importance also, to
a later detailed discussion, it is very clear and of central
consequence in our science that a diversity of relative
advantage in different things displays itself as between
the individuals of every community and country large and
small. There is no hamlet in any land in which one man
has not an advantage over his neighbors in the making of
clothes, another in the making and setting of horse-shoes, a
third in the building of houses, a fourth in the curing of
diseases, and another in the keeping a school; while each
of those neighbors has undoubtedly some advantage or
other over each of these in some trade or means of livelihood.
As a natural result of this diversity any two of these
villagers may profitably exchange their respective efforts
with each other, provided of course each has a desire for
the product of the other, to the manifest lessening of the
effort of each relatively to the satisfaction of each, and
the more so as the relative superiority of each to the other
in his own trade is the greater.</p>

<p>This point will repay some pains in minute illustration.
If the blacksmith can make and set horse-shoes only a trifle
better than the tailor could do this if he tried, and the tailor
can make coats only a little better than the blacksmith
could make one if he chose, there will be but a slight
benefit to each in their changing works with one another.
For the sake of definiteness, let us say, that the tailor's
capacity for making coats is 6, and his capacity in making
and setting horse-shoes is 5; and also that the blacksmith's
capacity for shoeing horses is 6, and his ability in making
coats is 5. Each has a relative superiority to the other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
of 1 in his own trade; and if they exchange efforts, as they
probably would under these circumstances, there is only
an advantage of 2 to be divided between them.</p>

<p>Now let us suppose (what might easily become a fact),
that the tailor by exclusive and augmented attention to
the conditions of his own craft carries up his capacity for
making coats to 15, the blacksmith's efficiency in both the
trades remaining the same as before. There will now be
an increased motive to both the artisans for exchanging
products with one another, and a larger gain to each than
before as the result of such exchange. The diversity of
relative advantage as between the two has now gone up
from 2 to 11. The tailor can now make a coat much better
and quicker than before; and though the blacksmith owing
to his inertness can neither make nor set horse-shoes any
better than before, still less make coats any better, he will
after all by still trading with the tailor reap a part of the
benefit of the latter's increased efficiency in making coats;
the new coat is at once better and costs less than the
previous one; the tailor is still less inclined than before to
leave his new and greater advantage over the blacksmith
to set himself to shoeing his own horse; even on the old
terms the blacksmith can do that 1 better than he himself
can, and rather than forego the trade he will naturally
offer the blacksmith somewhat better terms than before,
or in other words will feel impelled to share with the
blacksmith a part of the proceeds and rewards of his own
now superior skill and diligence. The trade began on the
sole basis of a relative diversity of advantage as between the
two mechanics, each in his own craft; this relative diversity,
without which no exchange ever takes place between any
two persons, has now gone up as between these two from
2 units of advantage to 11 units of advantage; how will
these 11 units be divided in this case? Nobody can tell
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
exactly how they will be divided. Two things about it,
however, are <i>certain</i> at least in their tendencies and
potencies. The blacksmith is sure to get some part of the
extra fruit of his neighbor's new push and spirit, while the
tailor is sure to get as his own reward by much the larger
part of the whole blessed 11.</p>

<p>We must by no means omit to notice the logical inference
from this instance, nor fail to make the proper inductive
generalization from a sufficient number of similar instances.
It is this: no man can make any essential improvement in
any of the methods of producing material commodities,
without at the same time benefiting other people as well
as himself. Under natural law, which is no respecter of
persons, he can by no possibility selfishly take to himself
the entire fruits of his own growing skill and vigor. The
only way in which he can gather in at all the fruits of
these is to sell their proceeds in the open market. To
broaden his own market for now better and more abundant
goods he must offer them to everybody on somewhat better
terms than formerly&mdash;and the better the terms the broader
the market&mdash;and he can well afford to do this, because the
goods now cost him less of irksome human effort. Every
improvement in the production of commodities is precisely
of that complexion. The issue of every invention, of every
improved process of every kind, is, so far forth, a cheaper
product. And this public gain follows, must follow, individual
enterprise at single points, even when the great
mass of exchangers remain at the old stage of sluggishness.
Whatever increases at one point even, and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">a fortiori</i>
at two points, the diversity of relative advantage as between
any two exchangers, is of benefit to them both, and the
greater this relative diversity becomes the greater the
benefit to both.</p>

<p>Now let us see how the matter stands, when tailor and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
blacksmith at the same time feel and obey the impulses
to a more skilled and vigorous artisan life. Suppose the
blacksmith too carries up his efficiency in his own trade to
15, just as the tailor has done, the potency of each in the
trick of the other remaining as before at 5; under these
circumstances when the two come to trade with each other,
each has a relative superiority over the other of 10, and
there is an advantage of 20 points to be divided between
the two; the trade is now ten times more profitable to each
than it was at the outset, when there was only an aggregate
of 2 units for the division between two parties; and
accordingly the motive to an exchange and the gain of an
exchange as between tailor and blacksmith are ten times
greater than they were before. Therefore we lay down the
principle, as inductively ascertained and as universally
applicable to all exchanges, that the greater the relative
superiority at different points as between the parties
exchanging, the more beneficial and profitable do the
exchanges become to all the participators in them. If this
principle be just, and we may well flatter ourselves that it
will be found to be just, it follows, that every man who
has anything to buy or sell, is directly interested in the
highest success of his fellow-exchangers, that every trade
finds its own advantage in the success of all other trades,
and that all discoveries and inventions by which Nature
is made to pay tribute to art is, restrictions apart, so much
clear gain to the world at large. In the light of sound
and broad principles, what David Hume called the "Jealousy
of Trade" is simply silly.</p>

<p>The mainspring that impels all buyers and sellers to
quicken their movements and to improve their methods
and thus and otherwise to cheapen their costs of production,
is the natural press of <i>competition</i>. Somebody else is
offering this product, or will offer it, for less than we are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
now selling it for, and we must contrive some way by shortened
times or cheaper processes or a quicker zeal not to be
beaten in this market-race, is the silent argument ever
making itself felt on the mind and hand of the producer.
Such natural action always increases the general diversity
of relative advantage as among buyers and sellers.</p>

<p>But, on the other hand, whatever lessens or threatens to
lessen this natural and most beneficial stress of competition
among producers of similar commodities at home or abroad,
necessarily lessens the motive on the part of these producers
to excellence of quality in their goods and to cheapness
of their cost, because it makes less the diversity of
relative advantage as between these producers and those
producers of other commodities against which the first
exchange. The units of advantage that would otherwise
be divided between the exchangers are diminished; the
motives to trade and the rewards of trade are thus lessened
to each pair of parties subject to such diminution of competition,
and consequently to the community, or nation, or
family of nations, as a whole; and accordingly this is the
precise place for us to look into the nature and effects of
<i>Monopoly</i>, so called, and to perceive once for all, that
Monopoly is the enemy of mankind.</p>

<p>Monopoly is a word derived from two Greek words,
which mean when combined <i>selling alone</i>, that is, the privilege
of selling one's commodity free from the competition
to which it is naturally subject by other sellers than the
privileged one. Monopoly is thus artificial restraint imposed
on some buyers and sellers for the supposed benefit
of other buyers and sellers. It is wholly unnatural. It is
usually enjoyed under the forms of law. Its beneficiaries
commonly cajole or extort from Government by hook or
by crook the exclusive privilege of selling certain commodities
in a designated market. Their motive is purely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
selfish: it is simply and solely to get for themselves a
return-service artificially enhanced by selling commodities
in a legally restricted market. The effect in the first instance
usually corresponds to their expectations. The
public are at their mercy so far as the designated commodities
are concerned.</p>

<p>The general story of monopolies is a dreary stretch of
record of human greed and wrong on the one hand, and
of wide-spread poverty and suffering and slowly-gathering
resistance on the other. We will look at only two instances
at present in the long account, premising that, the
motives of greed and grab are the same in all instances,
and the results of wrong and hate on the part of those
oppressed by them are the same also in all instances.
Let Macaulay (I, 40) tell us something of the first instance
selected for illustration. "<i>But at length the Queen
took upon herself to grant patents of monopoly by scores.
There was scarcely a family in the realm which did not feel
itself aggrieved by the oppression and extortion which this
abuse naturally caused. Iron, oil, vinegar, coal, saltpetre,
lead, starch, yarn, skins, leather, glass, could be bought only at
exorbitant prices. The House of Commons met in an angry
mood. It was in vain that a courtly minority blamed the
Speaker for suffering the acts of the Queen's Highness to be
called in question. The language of the discontented party
was high and menacing, and was echoed by the voice of the
whole nation. The coach of the chief Minister of the Crown
was surrounded by an indignant populace, who cursed the
monopolies, and exclaimed that the prerogative should not be
suffered to touch the old liberties of England. There seemed
for a moment to be some danger that the long and glorious
reign of Elisabeth would have a shameful and disastrous
end. She, however, with admirable judgment and temper,
declined the contest, put herself at the head of the reforming</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
<i>party, redressed the grievance, thanked the Commons in
touching and dignified language for their tender care of the
general weal, brought back to herself the hearts of the people,
and left to her successors a memorable example of the way in
which it behooves a ruler to deal with public movements which
he has not the means of resisting.</i>"</p>

<p>Perhaps some one of my readers may suggest, that
these are the words of a Whig-Liberal, and may thus
exaggerate the cause of the people as against the monopolists.
Well, then, let us hear the words of a high Tory-Loyalist,
the historian Hume (IV, 335, 350), in relation
to the same monopolies. "<i>The active reign of Elizabeth
had enabled many persons to distinguish themselves in civil
and military employments; and the Queen, who was not able
from her revenue to give them any rewards proportioned to
their services, had made use of an expedient which had been
employed by her predecessors, but which had never been carried
to such an extreme as under her administration. She
granted her servants and courtiers patents for monopolies;
and those patents they sold to others, who were thereby enabled
to raise commodities to what price they pleased, and
who put invincible restraints upon all commerce, industry,
and emulation in the arts. It is astonishing to consider the
number and the importance of those commodities which were
thus assigned over to patentees. Currants, salt, iron, powder,
cards, calf-skins, felts, pouldavies, ox-skin-bones, train
oil, lists of cloth, potashes, anise-seeds, vinegar, seacoals,
steel, aquavitæ, brushes, pots, bottles, saltpetre, lead, accidences,
oil, calamine stone, oil of blubber, glasses, paper,
starch, tin, sulphur, new drapery, dried pilchards, transportation
of iron ordnance, of beer, of horn, of leather, importation
of Spanish wool, of Irish yarn; these are but a
part of the commodities which had been appropriated to
monopolists. These monopolists were so exorbitant in their</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
<i>demands, that in some places they raised the price of salt
from sixteen pence a bushel to fourteen or fifteen shillings.
Such high profits naturally begat intruders upon their commerce;
and in order to secure themselves against encroachments,
the patentees were armed with high and arbitrary
powers from the Council, by which they were enabled to oppress
the people at pleasure, and to exact money from such
as they thought proper to accuse of interfering with their
patent. The patentees of saltpetre, having the power of
entering into every house, and of committing what havoc they
pleased in stables, cellars, or wherever they expected saltpetre
might be gathered, commonly extorted money from
those who desired to free themselves from this damage or
trouble. And while all domestic intercourse was restrained,
lest any scope should remain for industry, almost every
species of foreign commerce was confined to exclusive Companies,
who bought and sold at any price that they themselves
thought proper to offer or exact.</i>"</p>

<p>"<i>The Government of England during that age, however
different in other particulars, bore in this respect some resemblance
to that of Turkey at present: the Sovereign possessed
every power, except that of imposing taxes; and in
both countries, this limitation, unsupported by other privileges,
appears rather prejudicial to the people. In Turkey,
it obliges the Sultan to permit the extortion of the pashas and
governors of provinces, from whom he afterwards squeezes
presents and takes forfeitures: in England, it engaged
the Queen to erect monopolies, and grant patents for exclusive
trade; an invention so pernicious, that had she gone on
during a tract of years at her own rate, England, the seat
of riches, and arts, and commerce, would have contained at
present as little industry as Morocco or the coast of
Barbary.</i>"</p>

<p>But, some one will say, Hume and Macaulay are historians,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
writing long after these events took place, and may
likely have been too favorable in their judgment to freedom
of trade domestic and foreign. It is indeed true,
that both of them were firmly convinced that freedom of
trade is an inalienable right as well as an unspeakable
blessing to all men everywhere. So, then, let us go back
to contemporaries. Let us hear the eye and ear witnesses
of the grievances complained of in 1601. Robert Cecil
was then prime minister of Queen Elizabeth. He and his
father had had more to do in granting the monopolies than
any other persons in the realm except the Queen. Said
he from his place in the Commons on the 25th of November:
"<i>I say, therefore, there shall be a proclamation general
throughout the realm, to notify Her Majesty's resolution
in this behalf. And because you may eat your meat more
savory than you have done, every man shall have salt as
good and cheap as he can buy it or make, freely without
danger of that patent which shall be presently revoked. The
same benefit shall they have which have cold stomachs, both
for aqua vitæ and aqua composita and the like. And they
that have weak stomachs, for their satisfaction, shall have
vinegar and alegar, and the like, set at liberty. Train oil
shall go the same way; oil of blubber shall march in equal
rank; brushes and bottles endure the like judgment. Those
that desire to go sprucely in their ruffs, may at less charge
than accustomed obtain their wish; for the patent for starch,
which hath so much been prosecuted, shall now be repealed.
The patents for calf-skins and felts, for leather, for cards,
for glass, shall also be suspended, and left to the law.</i>"</p>

<p>Five days later one hundred and forty members of the
House were formally received by Elizabeth in person, the
Speaker having been instructed to convey their thanks to
her majesty; and, after the Speaker's address, he with the
rest knelt down, and the Queen gave her answer as follows:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
"<i>Mr. Speaker, you give me thanks, but I doubt me, I
have more cause to thank you all, than you me: for had I
not received a knowledge from you, I might have fallen into
the lap of an error, only for lack of true information. Since
I was queen, yet never did I put my pen to any grant, but
that upon pretext and semblance made unto me that it was
both good and beneficial to the subjects in general, though a
private profit to some of my ancient servants who had deserved
well; but the contrary being found by experience, I
am exceeding beholding to such subjects as would move the
same at first. I have ever used to set the last judgment-day
before mine eyes, and so to rule as I shall be judged to
answer before a higher judge. To whose judgment-seat I
do appeal, that never thought was cherished in my heart that
tended not to my people's good. And now if my kingly
bounty hath been abused, and my grants turned to the hurt
of my people, contrary to my will and meaning; or if any
in authority under me have neglected or prevented what I
have committed to them, I hope God will not lay their culps
and offences to my charge. Though you have had, and may
have, many princes more mighty and wise, sitting in this
seat, yet you never had, or shall have, any that will be more
careful and loving.</i>"<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>These were the last words of Elizabeth to the Commons
of England. She died in a little more than a year. In a
little less than a year before the death of her successor, the
famous Act of Parliament of 1624 declares, that all monopolies,
grants, letters patent for the sole buying, selling,
and making of goods and manufactures, shall be thereafter
wholly null and void. Though this Act, and many others,
was violated more or less in the next reign, it effectually
secured in the long run the freedom of industry in England;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
and in the opinion of excellent authorities, has done
more to excite the spirit of invention and industry, and
to accelerate the progress of commerce in that country,
than any other law on the statute book.</p>

<p>Our second instance of Monopolies shall be drawn from
the state of things in the United States in this year of
Grace, 1890. The monopolies of to-day are secured by
means of an instrument called a Tariff, which, later on in
these pages, will be fully discussed in its history, inmost
nature, and invariable effects. Here it will suffice to say,
that a tariff is nothing in the world but a combination of
Taxes, which taxes the people of the country, on which
the tariff is imposed, are obliged to pay in one form or
another. The only word ever uttered by a tariff, the only
word a tariff from its own nature can utter, is, <i>Thou shalt
pay</i>! The ostensible reason for levying these taxes is
the constitutional one of getting money into the national
Treasury,&mdash;"<i>to pay the debts and provide for the common
defence and general welfare of the United States</i>"; but the
real purpose of laying these tariff-taxes at present is only
secondarily and remotely the ostensible and constitutional
one; because, on the authority of Professor Taussig of
Harvard University, there is not a single one of over 4000
items of taxes in this tariff, that is designed primarily to
get money into the treasury from the pockets of the people,
but every one of them is designed more or less and
more rather than less to raise the price of domestic goods
to our own people artificially by keeping out of the
country by means of these taxes on them the foreign
goods, which would otherwise come into a profit. In
other words, there is no purely revenue-tax in our immense
tariff at present, but every item in the enormous
list is a so-called and mis-called "protective"-tax.</p>

<p>By this shutting off from domestic goods the natural
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
competition of corresponding foreign goods by means of
such tariff-taxes, a monopoly is created at the instance and
for the sole benefit of certain classes of privileged home-producers.
They can sell alone (monopoly) just so far as
other sellers are kept out by these heavy taxes. The goal
of all their striving is to get an artificially-enhanced price
for their own products at the cost of their countrymen
by means of a market restricted to themselves through
obstacles excluding foreign sellers. The end proposed by
these shrewd manipulators is realized in fact. Domestic
prices are lifted on so-called "protected" goods. This is
the first effect of the monopoly. It has often been alleged,
and with great vehemence by the late Horace Greely, that
competition among the domestic producers of such wares
will lower their price again to the natural point; but if
this is so, what <i>motive</i> have the individual producers to
work so assiduously in elections and lobbyings to get on
and keep on these tariff-taxes? Again, Mr. Greely, and
all others of like association, forgets the admirable generalization
of Robert Stephenson,&mdash;"<i>Where combination is
possible, competition is impossible.</i>" Combination among
producers to keep up prices is always possible in a market
restricted by law. This has been proven on a large scale
in the United States during each of the past thirty years:
combinations among coal operators to keep up the prices
of "protected" coal by restricting the annual output of
their collieries; combinations among carpet and other
woollen manufacturers to maintain high prices of their
fabrics by restricting their workmen to certain hours per
day or to certain months per year; have been among the
commonest of industrial events in all this interval. Within
a very few years past there has come into almost universal
vogue among these monopolists a new kind of combination
called "<i>Trusts</i>,"&mdash;again abusing a good word by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
making it cover an abominable purpose,&mdash;which are probably
illegal at Common Law, which only become possible
under monstrously unjust tariff laws, and which work
wide-spread wrong among the masses of the people.</p>

<p>A second effect of this monopoly (as of all monopolies)
is to worsen the quality of the goods sold in an artificially
restricted market. The historian Gibbon noticed this fact
more than a century ago, and said: "<i>The spirit of monopolists
is narrow, lazy and oppressive. Their work is more
costly and less productive than that of independent artists;
and the new improvements so eagerly grasped by the competition
of freedom, are admitted by them with slow and sullen
reluctance.</i>" Alfred Lapoint, United States consul in
Peru, warned the State Department at Washington in
1883 of this poor quality of our manufactures, which were
then trying to find a South American market. He wrote:
"<i>It is my duty to indicate that great carelessness prevails
with our manufacturers; for instance, I was called upon to
purchase in the United States a steam pump and boiler,
which I ordered from one of the most famed manufacturers,
and when it arrived, not alone was the boiler inadequate for
the pump, but actually after two months' work the upper tube
sheet split in three parts, a proof of its bad quality and construction.</i>"
As men are, a natural competition among
buyers and sellers is just as needful to keep up the quality
of goods as to keep down their price. Good quality
always costs more of effort and skill and capital than bad
quality: why should producers continue to furnish good
quality to a market from which a free competition in good
qualities is excluded by law? Every tendency of human
nature, as well as every relevant fact in history, attests,
that poor wares at high rates invariably attends upon tariff-monopolies.
Shoddy takes the place of wool. Cheaper
crowds out better material. Skilled workmanship is displaced
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
by unskilled. Processes of manufacture are hastened
in time, and left incomplete to the damage of the
goods in order to save capital. Monopoly is always and
everywhere the foe of excellence.</p>

<p>A third effect of tariff-monopoly is to prevent the sale
abroad of domestic goods to the same extent and amount
as foreign wares are kept out by these monopoly-taxes.
This vital and fundamental result is almost always overlooked.
If a man or a nation refuse to <i>buy</i> of a proffered
customer, they cannot by any possibility <i>sell</i> to him;
because buying and selling are reciprocal and synchronous;
because it takes two to make a bargain; because material
commodities, for the most part, ultimately, exchange
against each other; and because the only motive a foreigner
ever has to bring his goods <i>hither</i>, is to take in
exchange for them our domestic goods at a profit, and
carry these <i>hence</i>. To forbid entrance to foreign goods is
to forbid exit to domestic goods. Monopoly-tariff-taxes,
therefore, so far forth, destroy the market for home products,
without creating or tending to create, any other market
for them. Such taxes, accordingly, cause a dead loss
all around,&mdash;to the foreign producer who wants to buy
our products with his own, to the home producer who
wants to sell his own products against those, and even to
the government also as a tax-collector, which can get no
revenue on foreign goods excluded by monopoly-taxes.</p>

<p>There is a final and deeper point of view, from which
all such monopolies are wholly condemnable. <i>They lessen
of necessity,&mdash;from their own nature and inexorable operation</i>,&mdash;<span class="smcap">the
diversity of relative advantage as
between exchangers</span>, on which diversity, as we have
now seen, the whole fact and gain of exchanges depend.
Taxes on raw materials, for example, whether actually paid
on them or used to enhance the price of other corresponding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
materials as in the tariff-taxes, increase the costs of all
products into which such taxed materials enter, and so
restrict the market of the home-producer by lessening his
relative advantage as compared with the relative advantage
of the foreigner over him. He cannot sell so well,
perhaps cannot sell at all, his cost-enhanced products.
Monopoly-taxes on industrial processes of any kind, on the
means of transportation, have similar effects on the cost of
products; and of course, similar effects in lessening Diversity,
in restricting markets, and in destroying the life of
Trade.</p>

<p>Before quitting this subject, it may be well for us briefly
to classify Monopolies.</p>

<p>(a) Patent Rights. In the great parliamentary Statute
of 21 James I, which declared the exclusive privileges to
use any and to sell any merchandise to be contrary to
the ancient and fundamental laws of the realm, and all
grants and dispensations for such monopolies to be of none
effect, two exceptions had been made; the first, in favor of
Patents for fourteen years to the true and first inventors
of new manufactures within the realm; and the second,
in favor of the grants by Act of Parliament to any
Company for the enlargement of foreign Trade, of which
the East India Company chartered on the last day of the
last year of the sixteenth century became the most famous
and the longest-lived. Open letters or letters <i>patent</i>, as
they were called, giving to inventors exclusive authority to
vend for a limited time any chattel or article of commerce,
of which a <i>model</i> could be made showing the point and
application of what was claimed to be <i>new</i>; and Copyrights,
which grant an exclusive property also for a limited
time to authors and discoverers of something new and
useful, of which a model cannot be made, or, as it is
phrased in the Constitution of the United States, "<i>the</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
<i>exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries</i>";
are a part of the results among all English-speaking peoples
of the two exceptions in this famous and beneficent
Act of Parliament.</p>

<p>In the United States a patent lasts for 17 years, and is
not reissued except by a special act of Congress; a copyright
lasts for 28 years, and may be renewed by the author,
his widow, or children, for 14 years longer. In the constitution
of the new German Empire of 1871, this protection
of intellectual property (<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">der Schutz des geistigen Eigenthums</i>)
is expressly included in the matters which are to
be dealt with by the <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Reichstag</i> or imperial parliament.</p>

<p>Now while patents and copyrights are a monopoly under
the definition, they are quite distinct in their purpose and
spirit from the monopolies already described. On the
whole, Society does well in trying to protect, by law,
inventors and thinkers in the sole use and benefit of their
respective products for a brief and specified time. There
are large difficulties in the way of reaching this end practically,
as is proven by the endless and expensive lawsuits
in such cases, but the postulate on which it is
attempted is sound, namely, that otherwise citizens would
have less motive to think and to invent; since in that case
only the public-spirited and the rich could or would devote
themselves to an important branch of the public progress.
A patent or copyright is merely a return service which
Society renders for a service received. It violates no
man's right of property, as an ordinary monopoly does, but
on the other hand is a provision to protect for a time a
new right of property created by the thought and efforts
of a deserving class of men. The phrase, "intellectual
property," used above in translating from the German, is
not well chosen, since we have amply learned that anything
is property that can be bought and sold, that simple
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
rights of many kinds are constantly on sale in the market,
and consequently that patents and copyrights are at once
proper and property because they are a technical return-service
for other services ready to be rendered to the
community.</p>

<p>(b) Revenue Rights. Once at a court ball, Napoleon
the First noticed a lady very richly dressed and wearing
splendid diamonds, and on asking for her name, ascertained
that she was the wife of a tobacco manufacturer of
Paris; whereupon it occurred immediately to the quick
mind of the French ruler, that the State might just as well
have those great profits as an individual; and the sale of
tobacco in all its forms became accordingly a State monopoly
in the interest of taxation, and so it has continued to
this day, and yields now about 400,000,000 francs a year.
Other nations have adopted to some small extent this
mode of indirect taxation of their people. By legally cutting
off the competition of all private dealers in the taxed
article, and by preventing to the utmost of their power its
being smuggled into the country, Governments are enabled
to sell the article at a price enhanced artificially by
the monopoly; but all that the people are made to pay
<i>extra</i> under the monopoly, saving the costs of maintaining
it, goes directly into the treasury of the State; and, so
far forth, becomes an unobjectionable mode of taxation.
Under all forms of taxation, the aim should clearly be,
that the Treasury receive all that the People are made to
pay, except the cost of an economical collection.</p>

<p>(c) Tariff Monopolies. The United States has never
undertaken, like France and Germany, to vend directly
and exclusively an article taxed by themselves for the sole
purpose of revenue; but unfortunately they have undertaken
and still maintain (1890) monopolies a thousand
times more unjust and objectionable than any such revenue-monopoly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
can be; they have laid distinct tariff-taxes
upon thousands of foreign articles, not with the design of
getting revenue from them, but with an avowed and
realized design of <i>preventing</i> revenue by means of these
taxes, since they have made the taxes so high and onerous
as to be in many cases absolutely prohibitory of the entry
of the goods, and in all cases more or less prohibitory of
such entry. Revenue can only be gotten on goods that
come in, while the very intent and result of these taxes is
to shut the foreign goods out on which they are levied, so
as to give certain domestic producers (who have themselves
secured this legislation) the monopoly of the home
market in these goods.</p>

<p>This is the very core of public wrong-doing. This is the
worst form of monopoly that ever existed in a civilized
country. Queen Elizabeth's monopolies, which so roused
the ire of the Parliament of 1601, were nothing in enormity
as compared with these tariff-taxes. Civilization long
ago sloughed off such direct grants of personal privilege
as were forbidden forever by the Act of 1624, and accordingly
there is no need of mentioning these in the present
classification. Tariff-taxes for other ends than pure revenue
are the worst monopolies in existence, because (1)
they compel the people to pay under ostensible taxes
many times more than the Treasury gets from them in
actual revenue; (2) they are wholly deceptive in their
terms, and their operation is clothed in disguises difficult
to strip off; (3) they are always put on at the instance
and under the pressure of the man (or men) who expects
thereby to raise the price of his own wares at the expense
of his countrymen; (4) they create under legal forms
however unconstitutional privileged classes in the community;
(5) their first effect is invariably to make the
rich richer and the poor poorer; (6) their ultimate effect
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
is to impoverish the privileged classes themselves by taking
away from them the natural spur of competition and self-dependence,
in consequence of which their own goods
become poor, and their zeal flags, and they come to lean
still more heavily on monopoly-supports; (7) they destroy
the market for domestic goods to precisely the same extent
as they cut off the market for foreign goods, and (8) their
whole retinue of evils is wrapped up in the great fact, that
the <i>Diversity of Relative Advantage</i> is thereby diminished
both as among domestic producers of commodities and as
between foreign and domestic producers.</p>

<p>The expression, "natural monopoly," is sometimes used
of those, who, under freedom, and using to the utmost
their natural gifts and acquired skill, have distanced all
local competitors, and may be said to control the market
in their own interest, furnishing the best goods at the
cheapest rates. This is in no proper sense of the term a
"monopoly." Production has no complaint to make of
any such pre-eminence in excellence and opportunity. It
harms nobody and benefits everybody. Exchange rejoices
over every man and woman and child, who so puts his
head and heart and hand into his own peculiar product as
to outstrip all others in that one line in point of ease and
excellence, and so be able to offer a service at once better
and cheaper than any one else can offer it then and there;
and when all men and women and children, so far as they
are employed commercially, come to possess a "natural
monopoly" each in his own specialty, then Exchanges
become as profitable and progressive as possible then
and there, because the ever-blessed diversity of relative
advantage has its utmost limit.</p>

<p>4. We come now to consider the natural <span class="smcap">Limits</span>,
if any such there be, to the Production of material commodities.
This point has been much discussed. For example, Dr.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
Chalmers, a Scotch clergyman of great intelligence, profoundly
moved by the condition of the poor in Glasgow,
published in 1822 an interesting but not over-sound treatise
entitled "Political Economy," in which the proposition is
maintained, that the universal market is strictly limited,
and therefore that, were it not for the unproductive consumption
of the rich and luxurious, and the equally
unproductive consumption of national wars, there would
soon be a general glut of material commodities, and consequently
Production would have to cease for the lack of
a vent for its products. Pretty soon we shall be able to
detect the enormous fallacy in this proposition. On the
other hand, in 1803, Jean-Baptiste Say, a very competent
French economist, in chapter xv of his well-known treatise,
fully developed this very important proposition, if
true, namely, <i>that production may go on indefinitely in all
directions without ever a fear of reaching a general glut of
products</i>.</p>

<p>What is a market? What is a limited market? What
is an illimitable market? A market, as we have already
seen in substance, is nothing in the world but certain
<i>persons</i> somewhere with return-services in their hands
desirous to part with these in order to get, that is, to buy,
some other services offered in exchange. Each set of
services is equally a market in relation to the other set.
<i>A market is always persons having something in their hands
to sell.</i> Buyers and sellers are equally a market in relation
to each other. Whenever anybody goes forth to buy, he
must of course take with him something with which to
pay for what he wants to buy, that is to say, he must
become a seller the very instant he becomes a buyer; and
whenever anybody wants to sell something, he must of
course want something already in the hands of somebody
else, in which to take his pay, that is, he becomes a buyer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
the moment he becomes a seller. This helps us to see
perfectly what a market is. Defined in the terms of
persons, <i>a market is two men, each glad to get the product of
the other, and to render in return his own product</i>; defined
in the terms of things, <i>a market for products is products in
market</i>.</p>

<p>Now, what can limit the universal market for material
products? Clearly, it can only be limited either in the
element of <i>Desires</i> or in the element of <i>Return-Services</i>.
But the desires of all men, even of one man, which the
efforts of other men may satisfy, have never yet come to a
stand-still. Who ever heard of even one man, who was in
possession of all the products of all kinds, that he wanted?
Even if there were one such man somewhere, there are
millions upon millions of other men, whose desires for
products such as the efforts of other men can furnish are
unlimited in number and infinite in degree. It is not
possible, therefore, that there should be a lack of human
desires anywhere, that could put any bound to the production
of commodities or hinder in the least its ever-swelling
march.</p>

<p>If only two things can limit the universal market, and
if there never has been and never can be any lack on the
part of some men of Desires which the efforts of other
men can satisfy through exchange, can there ever be any
lack in the second element of a market, namely, in Return-services?
It is not meant to be asserted, that there are
not definite limitations at any one time or place, or in the
whole world at any given period, in the capacities of men
then and there to produce material commodities, with their
knowledge of things and powers of invention; but what <i>is</i>
meant to be asserted is this, that wherever Production is
most busy and universal in response to the desires of some
men somewhere, <i>there</i> will be the greatest plenty of return-services,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
with which to pay for the services of these "some
men somewhere" offered in response to the desires of
the first set of producers. Therefore, no general glut of
products is possible to occur. The more and the more
<i>kinds</i> of commodities produced anywhere, the better market
<i>that</i> for the more and the more kinds of commodities
produced somewhere else. The nearer Industry may seem
to be about to come to the goal of a limit, the farther off
from that goal it is in reality. The aggregate of human
industrial powers has indeed a potential limit at any one
moment, but the knowledge of things and the power of
invention and the means of transportation are enlarging
every moment of time; so that, that potential limit never
can become an actual limitation. Human industry will go
on enlarging and diversifying itself so long as the world
shall stand.</p>

<p>Let us put this vastly important argument in other and
briefer words: the Desires of men which the Efforts of
other men can satisfy through exchange are unlimited in
number and indefinite in degree; and therefore, mutual
industrial efforts can continue to be put forth in exchange,
until these unlimited and indefinite desires of all men are
all met,&mdash;a goal which clearly never can be reached.</p>

<p>This proposition demolishes at a stroke the fallacy, that
pervades Dr. Chalmers' book but just now alluded to;
and, what is more to the present point, demolishes equally
fallacies current and prevalent in the United States at this
hour. What our national industries need and all they
need, what they always needed and all they ever will need,
is a quick market for their products; products in market
is the only market for products; but the United States
for 30 years past has been putting vast obstacles in the
shape of formidable taxation in the way of the presence of
products from abroad in our domestic market, and consequently
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
and inexorably the market for domestic products
has been lost in foreign countries, to the immense and
irreparable damage of domestic producers as well as to the
foreign producers themselves.</p>

<p>No general glut of exchangeable products is possible to
take place in this world under natural liberty and just
law, because under these the diversity of relative advantage
and consequently the profitableness of commercial
exchanges is all the time widening everywhere, tending
to bring the whole earth into a commercial and blessed
union.</p>

<p>On the other hand, while a general glut of products is
impossible to occur under a decent freedom, a partial glut
in respect to certain commodities in certain places is very
common. Through want of foresight as to a prospective
demand, or miscalculation as to its probable amount, particular
services are sometimes offered in too great abundance
or of a kind not now adapted to the chosen market,
and in respect to these the market may truly be said to
be glutted. This frequently happens with editions of
books; more copies are printed than can be sold at paying
prices. Also, when the fashion changes, which is after
all less capricious than is commonly supposed, the goods
that were fashionable but are so no longer, are very apt to
be somewhere in excess of the demand for them. Nothing
can then hinder a partial or total loss in their value in the
hands of their last holders. Precautions, however, may
well be taken to avoid losses of this character, through the
cultivation of foresight, and by studying as accurately as
possible the nature of human desires and the not altogether
irregular changes that have been observed to take place in
them. This constitutes the art of mercantile sagacity;
and the most successful producers in all the departments
of exchange are those who best develop this attainable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
sagacity, who adapt their particular services closest to the
existing and to the coming demands; who, to excellence
in the substance of their products, add taste and attractiveness
to their form; and who, as the result of this, tend
rather to lead the fashions of the many than to follow in
their wake. It cannot be wrong to repeat here in substance,
what has indeed been said already in another connection,
that Production as a general rule is no dead level
of monotonous exertion,&mdash;no going forth and coming
back on precisely the same track,&mdash;since its sphere is
Life with all its wants and Man with all his desires; since
there is scope and verge enough for the development of
ingenious minds in almost all of its departments; and
since its ultimate goal is beyond the ken of man.</p>

<p>5. We must now study with considerable pains the
ultimate facts and the essential functions of <span class="smcap">Lands</span> in
connection with the Production of material commodities.
This has always been the most vexed question in our
Science; but it is approaching, even if it has not already
reached, a satisfactory and final solution. The present
writer believes that his own studies and researches have
thrown some original and important light upon the perplexing
problem of the Value of lands and of their produce.
His present readers are surely entitled to his clearest
possible presentation of all the facts and principles of this
radical question.</p>

<p>The French "physiocrats" of a hundred years ago,
founders of the first School in Political Economy, excellent
men for the most part as well as good economists in
general, thought, that lands were property in a peculiar
and eminent sense, that they were the ultimate source of
all values but their own, and that consequently lands
should bear the weight of the national taxes. English
economists, constituting with their followers in other countries
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
the second School in our Science, while not going to
the length of the physiocrats, still maintained that the
value of lands and of the produce of lands were distinct
in important respects from all other values whatever. In
our own time and country, Henry George, though belonging
for the most part to the third economic School, is a
great stickler for a single tax on lands in lieu of all other
taxes. We must, then, concentrate all the lights we can
gather on these points of dispute and difficulty.</p>

<p>(a) <i>The presumption in science is always against the
existence of a few outlying cases, whenever the induction
has been long and carefully conducted by many persons, and
the generalization appears on all other grounds to be sound
and comprehensive.</i> All induction proceeds upon the premise,
that Nature is <i>uniform</i> in those essential resemblances
that constitute a <i>class</i> of things in science. Nature has so
often justified confidence in her essential resemblances
even under the greatest differences in external circumstance
and apparent diversity, that the presumption
becomes immensely strong in her favor, whenever a generalization
patiently gathered from many particulars seems
to cover the whole ground concerned except a few obstinate-looking
items, that have not yet been closely studied.
Two to one these items also will presently fall into their
predestined place. We have already seen abundant
grounds for believing, that Values arise from human services
rendered and received: is it at all likely, considering
the nature of scientific generalization and the history of
all the more advanced sciences, that in Political Economy,
lands and their produce should be found to constitute an
outlying exception to the law of all other valuable things?</p>

<p>(b) There is one vital distinction to be made at the
outset and held to throughout the discussion, namely, that,
between all lands as a <i>physical thing</i>, which God made and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
gave to all men in common without any effort of their
own, and some lands now as a <i>valuable thing</i>, in all
probability made such through the action of human desires
and human efforts brought to bear upon what <i>was</i> merely
physical but what has now <i>become</i> valuable. The failure
to distinguish between <i>lands</i> as such and <i>valuable lands</i> as
such, has always wrought confusion and mischief in the
land problem. The two things are utterly different and
incommensurable. There are vast stretches of lands on the
surface of the earth, to which no <i>value</i> ever attached or
ever will attach. They are lands, and that is all. Political
Economy has nothing to say of them, and nothing to do
with them. Because they are never bought or sold,
because they never give birth to "produce," they lie wholly
outside the field of Value. Then there are immense areas
of lands now valuable, that were once as valueless as the
first class. With these Political Economy has a great deal
to do, and also with the way in which they passed from
valueless to valuable. Then there is a third class of lands,
that have not yet been studied as they ought and till
recently have not been studied at all, namely, those known
to have been valuable at one time, but which have now lost
their value either wholly or in large measure. There are
such lands as these in every State of our Union, and in
every civilized country beneath the sun; and Political
Economy has already learned something, and is destined to
learn much more, about the processes by which lands pass
from out the first great class into the second, and from the
second into the third. Valueless, Valuable, Unvalued,&mdash;these
three words describe to the economist all the lands of
the world.</p>

<p>(c) If we may trust the simple record in Genesis, the
whole earth was given of God to the whole race, under the
direction that they "<i>replenish and subdue it</i>." All the lands
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
were then certainly valueless, although some of them were
doubtless possessed of Utility, that is, a capacity to gratify
human desires through a direct appropriation, which is a
very different thing from Value, which last is the rendering
and receiving of equivalents as between two persons. It
seems very plain, that under this word, "Subdue," and
under the human services implied in that, came in the
first idea of ownership in land. When a family or tribe
commenced the work of subjugation upon a piece of land,
when they enclosed it, settled on it, tilled it, in any way
whatever improved it by their own toil, then <i>could</i> first the
idea of ownership dawn upon their minds, then first began
that land to be capable of value, since now that family
might reasonably say to another, If you want this field, you
must give us an equivalent for what we have expended on
it to improve it. If the transfer took place, what was it
that was sold? What was it that was paid for by the party
of the second part? It could not be the inherent quality
of the soil, it could not be anything that the first family
had gratuitously entered upon, because similar free land
with all its inherent qualities lay open to occupation on
every hand, and the second family would surely say, For
as much effort as you have put upon your land to better it,
we can make other free land as good as yours, consequently
we can give you no more at the most than a fair equivalent
for your efforts already expended. If the parcel were sold,
therefore, the <i>value</i> of it must have been determined,
not by the <i>gratuitous</i> elements involved but the <i>onerous</i>
elements involved. The physical thing, land, which cost
nothing, has now become the valuable thing, land, through
a series of human efforts expended of such kind as call
out human desires for the results reached, and justify the
rendering of return-services for them; and that which the
buyer pays for is never the free <i>old</i> but always the onerous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
<i>new</i>; new utilities, that cost something, have been added
to and intermixed with old utilities, that cost nothing;
and solely in consequence of this expenditure of efforts on
the part of some men, answering to the desires and calling
out the efforts of other men, do parcels of land pass out
from the first great class into the second great class. So
far as it can be gathered from the nature of the case, and
from the known steps of past experience, this is the simple
and rational process by which valueless lands become
valuable, and <i>less</i> valuable become <i>more</i> valuable lands.</p>

<p>(d) This line of proof, strong in itself, is strengthened
by observing how land-parcels gradually and practically
pass out from the second into the third class of lands,&mdash;from
the Valuable into the Unvalued. As it is only human
Efforts wisely bestowed upon valueless lands or in some
connection with them, that ever make these valuable, so it
is, that these Efforts intermitted for a time, or less wisely
bestowed, or reckoned less in harmony with the present
and prospective desires of other men, invariably cause a
loss of value in valuable lands; and, if such neglect or
unwisdom of effort continue long enough, nothing is more
certain, than that lands so treated will lose their value
altogether, nobody will give anything for them, they will
drop out from the second class into the third by the same
path (only in inverse order), by which they crept at
first from valueless to valuable. Under the writer's own
observation in different parts of New England, whole tiers
of farms once valuable and productive have lost that
character either wholly or for the most part, taxes can no
longer be collected from them, nobody will really give
anything for them in exchange, they are abandoned of
their former owners, they are left to lie waste or to grow
up into forest again. It follows from all this beyond a
doubt, and the logical issue is one of vast consequence to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
mankind, that Value is no attribute of matter, no inherent
quality of lands as such wherever situated, but it comes
and goes, it is a relation of mutual purchase between
human services rendered and received.</p>

<p>(e) Land-parcels becoming valuable in the way but just
now indicated, and so long as they continue valuable, that
is, salable, are technically <i>Commodities</i>, according to our
triple division of all Valuables. They belong in this
grand division, that we are specially studying in this
chapter, for the same reason as a horse does or a steam-engine
does. Men did not originally make the land as a
congeries of matter, neither do men make horses, nor do
they make the iron ore out of which most parts of the
steam-engine is made; but men do modify bits of the land
as God made it, they subdue it, they improve it in manifold
ways, they make it <i>desirable</i> in the eyes of other men,
and thus or otherwise they come into possession of it, gain
for themselves a right to sell it, prepare it to be sold and
sell it, on the same principle as men raise and break and
train horses and prepare them to be sold and sell them,
and just as men by many processes transform the iron ore
into a steam-engine and sell that. Ricardo, in his famous
doctrine of Rent, says a good deal about "the original and
indestructible powers of the soil"; but as a matter of fact,
<i>there are no such powers</i>, since the elements and properties
that constitute land are all the time changing under chemical
and other action; and even if there were such powers,
it would still be impossible to separate what God did for
the land from what men have done in order to fit it to be
sold; and what men have ever been authorized to take
pay from other men for what God did in the creation of
the world? The simple truth is, that Value is never of
God's creation but only of men's exertion. There never
was any land anywhere fit for cultivation and sale without
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
more or less expenditure of human labor and reserved
capital upon it; and the "powers" of the land, whatever
they are, instead of being "indestructible," are in a constant
process of wearing out, and require a constant application
of labor and capital to keep up their fertility.
Valuable pieces of land, accordingly, like all other commodities,
derive their <i>utility</i> partly from the free contribution
of Nature, and partly from the onerous contribution
of men; but, on the other hand, they derive their <i>value</i>,
whether the value be then increasing or diminishing,
wholly from human desires and corresponding efforts.</p>

<p>(f) It is but a step from this impregnable position to
another, namely, that Henry George is wholly wrong in
his view, that there is Value in lands as God made them
and gave them to men in common; and consequently,
wholly wrong in his doctrine, that a single tax on land
values would be just and equal to land owners, and might
well be made to take the place of all other taxes on all
other persons. He says: "<i>If we are all here by the equal
permission of the Creator, we are all here with an equal title
to the enjoyments of his bounty.</i>" What bounty? If he
means the original utility which God put into all lands in
common, and which certain men have done nothing to
better, there is nobody to dispute his proposition. But he
does not mean that, because there is nothing of any significance
that could come out of that. What he means is,
that it is God and not man who makes lands valuable. He
makes no distinction between Utility and Value in lands.
He lumps the two together in one, and calls the aggregate
the Creator's "bounty." He goes on to say: "<i>There is
on earth no power which can rightfully make a grant of exclusive
ownership in land.</i>" Well! Is there any power on
earth which can rightfully deny to any man or family the
proprietorship of his own exclusive <i>efforts</i>, nobody's else
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
rights being infringed thereby? Or can deny to him or
them the <i>results</i> of such efforts, however embodied?
When valueless lands are made valuable by human efforts
expended to that end, does not the "value" belong to
those who made it? When valuable lands have been
made more valuable than they were by the efforts and
foresight of their owners, the rights of others untouched,
does not the "increment" belong to those who have created
it? The truth is, if Henry George's powers of radical
analysis had been at all equal to his remarkable power of
rhetorical presentation, the world would never have been
treated to his popular and imposing land-fallacies. Prudhon's
"Property is theft," and George's "Single tax on
land," rest on the same basis of socialism.</p>

<p>(g) All valuable land-parcels are material Commodities,
made to be such by onerous human efforts of some sort
expended upon or in some connection with the free Utilities
furnished by Nature; the utilities are one thing in origin
and function, and the values are a very different thing both
in origin and function; and the present point is, that
nearly all valuable lands everywhere are Capital also, that
is to say, products reserved to aid in a further and future
production. Capital is a relatively small class under the
immensely large class Values. Capital is by no means
coincident with Commodities, since vast lines of the latter
are consumed with no reference to a further production
by means of their use. But capital is always either
commodities or claims, and valuable bits of land are
always commodities and nearly always capital; because
all tillage and pasture lands, all forests grown for wood and
timber, and lands of all sorts rented or held for resale at a
higher price, are capital under the definition, are "<i>products
reserved as an aid to further production</i>." The peculiarity
of all farming lands is this, they are themselves commodities,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
in whose creation God's free gifts and men's onerous labors
have conspired; and they are held in reserve by their
owners as capital, for the sake of producing by their means
with the help of more of God's free gifts further valuable
commodities, such as grain, and fruit and timber. Farms
in their highest reach of previous culture still need for
crops the sun and the rain. Indeed the sun is the most
useful and powerful force in the world. Oh! how it warms
and lifts and quickens! Give it and the rain and the dew
but a fair chance on lands properly prepared for them,
and endless fields blossom like the rose and are white to
the harvest!</p>

<p>Agriculture always has been and always will be the
vocation of the masses of mankind. Under a fair freedom,
and a decent law, and a reasonable industry, Agriculture
is always profitable; because it is natural, that is, designed
by God for the welfare of mankind; because it lies at the
basis of all other industries,&mdash;most of the food of mankind,
most of the raw material of all manufactures, most of the
subject-matter of all national and international commerce,&mdash;come
out of the farms of the world; because it has been
ordered so in the nature of things, that, under a tolerable
freedom, a given amount of agricultural products tends
constantly to buy, that is, to pay for, more and more of
almost all kinds of manufactured products, for a reason to
be explained shortly, thus tending strongly to uplift the
farming masses in a scale of comforts; and because there
is no other main line of human activities so constantly
and so prodigiously and so gratuitously assisted by Natural
Agents as is Agriculture. As Milton has profoundly
expressed it in the "Hymn to the Nativity," the Sun is
indeed to Mother Earth "<i>her lusty paramour</i>." But at
this very time of writing a wail is coming up in ever
deepening tones from Italy and France and Germany and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
Russia and especially the United States, that a colossal
blunder in legislation common to all these countries now,
say rather a colossal crime of the powerful few against the
humble many, in the shape of tariff-monopolies, neutralizes
in large part these natural advantages of agriculture,
makes farming unprofitable and farmers unable to pay
their taxes, diverts young men in increasing numbers from
the farms to the towns, plasters the lands over with
mortgages, shuts out from their natural markets the
products of the land, thus depressing their price, and shuts
off from farmers by outrageous taxes their natural supplies,
thus augmenting their price. Farmers in all these countries
are revolving between the upper and the nether millstones.
Count Giusso, ex-Mayor of Naples, and now a deputy from
that city, has just made a speech in the Italian Parliament,
which sets forth in strong terms the great depression
in Agriculture, and the critical condition of the public
finances, brought about by the new policy of protectionism
there. He says: "<i>The Utopian idea of creating an
industrial Italy on the ruins of an agricultural Italy, has
been a colossal error big with disastrous results. We have
preferred the shop to the land; we have preferred the coal
we do not possess to our Italian sun; we have preferred the
motive force of steam to the most powerful motive force in
the universe, the sun; and we are naturally suffering the
sad consequences.</i>" Exports increased in Italy in 1888 by
$24,000,000, and imports by $42,000,000; and the Count
quotes the cry coming up from one end of the Peninsula
to the other: "<i>Give us the means of selling our products,
and we will pay the taxes.</i>" England is the only considerable
country in the world, whose customs-revenue increased
in the fiscal year 1888-89 over the year before; this English
increase was over 5 <i>per centum</i>, which means an increase
both in imports and exports, whose movements are almost
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
absolutely free so far as England is concerned; while in
all the countries mentioned above, which are under a
different system in that respect, there was a <i>deficit</i> of
revenue from tariff-taxes as compared with the year before,
and a <i>decrease</i> in both exports and imports.</p>

<p>(h) If nearly all bits of valuable lands be capital, as we
have just seen strong grounds for believing, then it follows
of course, <i>that the Rent of leased lands whether for buildings
or harvests is the same in nature with the Interest on money
loaned, and is the measure of the service rendered by the
owners to the actual users of the Capital</i>. This proposition,
seen in its radical proofs and in its logical corollaries, takes
the very life out of Henry George's land-theories, and out
of the popular remedies thereto annexed. The writer
firmly believes also, that this proposition in the grounds of
it and in the inferences from it might have been used by
Mr. Gladstone and his followers with telling effect in the
animated discussions of the Irish land-question in the British
Parliament during the decade 1880-90. In the debates
on the Irish Land Bill passed in 1881, the representatives
of the land-owners in Ireland held to their right to take
all the rent they could extort by the help of the law; on
the other hand the representatives of the Irish rent-payers
held to their right as cultivators and maintainers to withhold
rent in large part or altogether; and Mr. Gladstone,
as representative of the nation, while insisting on the
right of the owners to certain rents, insisted equally on
the right of the cultivators to certain important privileges
in the soil. Our present proposition with those that
spring out of it, though it was not used by Gladstone, as
it might well have been to smooth his pathway through
the roughness of that legislation, yet justifies at one and
the same time the discontent of the Irish rent-payer, the
claim of the Irish land-holder to an assured rent of some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
sort, and the fundamental principle of the Irish Land Bill
of 1881. That bill gives a certain modified ownership and
control to the actual cultivators and maintainers of the
soil. That is right.</p>

<p>The principle of land-values herewith enunciated, their
uprise and increase and frequent decay also in all land-parcels,
justifies completely the concessions to tenants in
that bill; while the old and still commonly accepted
English principles of land, and the false yet famous doctrine
of Rent promulgated by Ricardo at the beginning of
the century, are wholly against Gladstone and his concessions
in that bill. Let us now see whither simple analysis
and logical processes will quickly bring us in this whole
matter. Valuable land was once valueless, and always
remained so, until, by virtue of human efforts expended
upon it or in some direct connection with it, coupled with
the desires of certain other men for that land or its produce,
accompanied with a readiness on the part of these
men to render some equivalent for it or its use, first
imparted value to that particular patch; moreover, it has
been found in practice ten thousand times, just as one
would expect, knowing the origin of value in general,
that, unless human efforts are further and constantly
expended on or in connection with that piece, and unless
desires of other men continue to turn towards it in the
way of exchange, its value will silently and inevitably
escape from it; therefore, whoever has come into possession
of that valuable piece of land by purchase or inheritance,
and foregoes the use of it in favor of another
as a tenant, is morally and commercially entitled to the
stipulated return for that use, <i>which is rent</i>; but also, if
that other, aside from the current use which is always a
wearing-out process, contributes in any way to the continuance
and increase of the value and fertility of the land,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
then and so far he gains rights in the land and becomes a
sort of joint owner of it, since what he has done in the way
of maintenance and improvement is inextricably mingled
with what the other owners or users have done, and is of
the same nature with that; and, therefore, the modified
ownership of certain tenants recognized in Gladstone's bill
is in strict accordance with ultimate justice, as it is also
in strict accord with right, that the legal owner should
continue to receive a return in the shape of rent for all
the fertility and opportunity actually contributed by him,
and no more. The discontent of the Irish peasantry has
largely come from an instinct or intelligence more unerring
than the economics of the land-owners, namely, that
they are called on to pay rent for what they themselves
have <i>contributed</i> in addition to the rent for what they have
<i>received</i>. The true origin of value in land, and the only
way in which value in land is kept up, seems to have
penetrated deeper into the minds of Irish tenants than into
the minds of many British statesmen.</p>

<p>(i) If the bulk of all valuable land-parcels be capital,
as it is, then one might expect beforehand to find <i>a law of
diminishing returns</i> from such lands, agricultural labor
and skill remaining the same; because, all capital is tools
made such by the expenditure of human efforts on changeable
material, and then by the practice of <i>abstinence</i>, and
tools from their very nature are always wearing out.
Increase of efforts in connection with any form of capital
unimproved by new inventions and uninvigorated by fresh
skill, though they may indeed increase the aggregate
return, cannot, for the reason just given, <i>secure an increase
proportioned to the increase of the efforts</i>. The English
writers generally, and Mr. Ricardo in particular, justly lay
much stress on this proposition, although they have not
taken lands to be capital, and have proven the law of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
diminishing returns in a different way from ours, and consequently
have not set the propositions of land in their
best and most ultimate relations. Their method of proving
the law, however, is short and conclusive: If by doubling
the efforts upon a piece of land, double the produce
could be secured, and by quadrupling it, quadruple, and
so on, there would be no reason why any man should ever
cultivate more than a square acre, or even a square rod.
He has a strong motive to confine his culture to a small
space, just so long as the amount of produce is in the ratio
of the efforts expended, because there is less locomotion of
tools and fertilizers and crops. The fact that he extends
his culture from one acre to another, and then to distant
acres, notwithstanding the inconvenience and expense of
transportation, is an irrefragable proof of the proposition
in question. Increase of agricultural efforts and expenditures
on a given space of land will secure a larger amount
of produce, but as a general law, <i>the increased amount will
not be proportioned to the increased expenditure</i>.</p>

<p>It is through this law of diminishing returns, that the
Creator has secured the gradual occupation, by men, of
almost the whole earth. There is a strong and natural
tendency to leave the old acres to advance upon new, the
old countries to emigrate to new, whenever the returns
begin to bear a more unfavorable ratio to the labors
bestowed. The farmer will advance from the first to the
second acre as soon as he thinks that more produce can be
obtained from it by a given amount of efforts than can be
gotten by a like expenditure of additional efforts upon the
first acre, allowance being made for the increased inconvenience;
and so, cultivation has gradually extended itself
and men have become dispersed over the whole earth.
Other principles leading to dispersion have undoubtedly
co-operated, but this is the fundamental one, operative at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
all times, changing the course of population, and consequently
of empire.</p>

<p>(j) It follows from the points already made, <i>that all
permanent improvements in agriculture retard the operation
of the law of diminishing returns</i>. The recent introduction
of the silo, for example, upon the long-used and wearing-out
farms of New England promises, if the public law
would quit throwing in obstacles, to help restore the fertility
of many of them. The discovery of new and more
available fertilizers, the invention of better agricultural
implements, the light thrown by chemistry upon agriculture,
the consequent adoption of better methods of culture
and rotation of crops, the more perfect adaptation to the
various soils of the kinds of produce sought to be raised
from them,&mdash;all these and similar improvements tend to
increase the ratio of produce to the labor, and to disguise
the law just established. The lands that are now under
cultivation may be made, under more skilful modes of
culture to yield indefinitely more than at present, and the
vast still uncultivated lands of the world may come to
render an incalculable quantity of food to the world's
population; but yet, as improvements are naturally less
continuous in this than in most other departments of production,
as invention has much less play, as there is less
opportunity for the division and co-operation of laborers,
<i>as nothing can materially shorten the time during which the
fruits of the earth must ripen</i>, it is certain that possible
improvements will never override the law of diminishing
returns; and, consequently, <i>that the value of agricultural
produce tends constantly to rise relatively to manufactured
products generally</i>.</p>

<p>(k) The last point to be made under the general topic
we are now discussing, is, <i>that the best tenure of lands in
the interest of the production of material commodities is the</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
<i>fee simple in the hands of the actual cultivators</i>. This is
the old Teutonic holding; but special circumstances in
the British Islands have gradually changed these small
holdings once cultivated by the hands of their free owners
into large estates, the parts of which are leased out at will
or for a term of years to tenants or "farmers" as they are
there called, who, in turn, being small capitalists, as the
land-owners are large capitalists, furnish the stock and hire
the laborers and thus become the actual cultivators, and
even often sublet parts of their own leased holdings to
tenants of the next degree below, who can furnish less
stock and can hire fewer laborers. The word "farmer" as
used in the United States has a quite different meaning
from that it bears in Great Britain; it means here a man
cultivating his own fields with his own funds in his own
way, and it means there a man cultivating another's fields
with his own funds in a way and on terms made a matter
of contract between the two; and these two modes of
culture are so distinct that they are not likely to lie
alongside of each other to any great extent for a very long
time in the same country. Since her great Revolution,
and under the action of the law requiring the equal
partition of every man's landed estate among all his
children, France has had for the most part the small holding
tilled by the owner's own hands, instead of the great estates
of the old <i>régime</i>, the average being about 14 acres to each
owner, and nearly one fourth of the entire population
being proprietors of land either in town or country; in the
United States the plough is guided almost wholly by the
man who owns the soil he tills; while in Great Britain the
original peasant proprietor has almost entirely disappeared.
Each system has its advocates and arguments.</p>

<p>The question at bottom is, whether capital in the form of
tillable land is more <i>effective</i> when held in large masses
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
and loaned out to men, who possess small capitals in
another form than land, and are willing to apply these for
a return upon that land, or when held in small masses and
used as capital by the owners themselves, who also own
some capital in another form than land and are willing to
apply this to their own profit upon their land. We hold,
that the latter method is better than the former, both for
the maintenance and improvement of the land itself as
capital and also for the current production of commodities
from it, because, (1) when one owns the farm he works,
from the very nature of permanent ownership he takes a
greater interest in it, perhaps he has inherited it from his
fathers, perhaps he has bought it and paid for it at the
hardest, at any rate it is his own, and as all men work from
<i>motives</i> and the energy of the work is proportioned to the
constant press of the motives, then must the owner of
the capital, whose abstinence <i>makes</i> it capital, be under
the strongest possible motive at once to improve his capital
and also to make the current produce from it as great as
possible, since the capital itself and all it yields is his own;
moreover, (2) ownership improves the moral <i>character</i> of
the cultivators, it tends to make them industrious, thrifty,
frugal, independent, hopeful of the future, anxious to give
their children better privileges than they themselves had,
and it would seem as if the masses of men are educated by
nothing so much, at least by nothing more, as and than by
the <i>ownership</i> of land, wherever such tenure is possible and
easy to the masses; and (3) the outward testimony is
abundant from many lands, that the peasant proprietor <i>is</i>
a happier and more virtuous man, a more productive and
progressive one, than the mere tenant and farm-laborer,
while there is much perhaps less conclusive testimony that
leased lands are inferior in point of improvements and
productiveness to the same lands when cultivated by their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
owners and to contiguous or at least similar lands still so
cultivated.</p>

<p>It is a cognate point yet worthy of separate mention,
that a general division of lands into farms only moderately
large and approximately equal is most favorable to the
largest aggregate production. Such a division takes place
of itself wherever the lands are held in fee simple, and the
cost of land-transfers is slight, and there are no such
obstacles as slavery or primogeniture, as has happened
practically in New England and in the Middle and Western
States, and as is now happening of its own accord more or
less at the South. The Greek writer, Aristotle, quoted
some centuries before Christ from "the African," probably
some Carthaginian writer on agriculture, the now familiar
saying, "<i>the best manure for the land is the foot of the owner</i>."
This homely word long attributed to Dr. Franklin, who
stole it for his "Poor Richard's Almanack" more than a
century ago, is based on the sound principle, that personal
supervision to be most effective must be limited in its
sphere, and that the best agricultural skill becomes weak
when it attempts to exhibit itself on too broad a surface.
Because a man can cultivate 100 acres better than any of
his neighbors, it does not prove that he will cultivate
50 acres additional to them better than a neighbor of
inferior skill, who is the owner of these 50 and no more.
When the freeholds are small and nearly equal a wide
competition among the farmers comes naturally into
play, success is seen to depend upon personal efforts of
intelligence and will, and interest and hope become the
motives to the most productive cultivation. There is a
high pleasure in possession and in self-guided exertion, and
an impulse is broadly felt over the whole region to get as
much as possible out of the land and at the same time to
keep good and ever improve its condition. To protect and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
advance his own interests, to attend upon the seasons, to
watch and wait, to foresee and plan and labor,&mdash;all this
develops the farmer, and gives him energy and independence;
and wherever there is a broad basis of such
independent yeomanry to lean back upon, when heavy
taxes are to be raised and strong blows of battle are to be
struck, the national safety and position are assured.</p>

<p>6. We come now in the last place to consider the <i>Costs
of Production</i> of material commodities of all sorts. Valuable
patches of land, all prepared for Production in its
several kinds, are the most important Commodities in the
world, and the largest also in volume of Value. What did
it cost "<i>to subdue</i>" the present tillable lands of this country?
How much did it cost to get ready for grazing the
broad pastures? To make accessible the forests that yield
the timber? To open up the mines also and bring them
into "touch" with the population? These questions are
of great consequence, not that the actual past cost of any
class of these more permanent "commodities" in the commercial
world will be any safe guide to their present value,
since cheaper and cheaper means of subduing the rugged
forms of Nature are all the while coming into play, and all
things that did cost more once tend pitilessly to fall to
what similar things cost now; and since also it is never
"efforts" alone that determine the value of anything, but
efforts in conjunction with the "desires" of other men.
Still, the <i>amount</i> of efforts expended at any given time
upon these more stable commodities to make them productive,
that is, their cost of production, is always gauged in
general by an <i>estimate</i> of what the "desires" for them will
be when completed; and this makes their cost of production
a sort of loose measure of their value at the time.
The main reason, however, why the cost of production of
these primal commodities, namely, valuable land-patches,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
whatever may be expected to be produced from them afterwards,
is so important, is, that as a general rule, the less
the cost of any commodity meeting a universal want <i>the
wider and surer is its market</i>. The larger the circle of the
buyers of anything the more certain its sale; because, the
world over, the men of small incomes are manifold larger
in number than the men of large incomes. Society is like
a pyramid: the lowest course of masonry is the longest
and widest,&mdash;has the most stones or bricks in it,&mdash;and
ever fewer towards the top.</p>

<p>If we reckon valuable lands as the <i>primary</i> commodities,
then the <i>secondary</i> commodities will be of two classes,
namely, (1) the <i>produce</i> of these valuable lands, whether
animal or vegetable or mineral, such as cattle and cereals
and coal; and (2) vendible material products obtained by
human efforts from non-valuable land and sea, such as furs
and fish. This division of material commodities into
primary and secondary, and the distinction among secondary
commodities according as their source is costly and costless,
has never before been drawn in Political Economy;
and it is fully believed, that the thoughtful reader and
student will pretty soon perceive its advantages in helping
clear up one of the most confused and perplexing sections
of our Science, namely, that which relates to the causes
and measures of <i>Rent</i>. We are now to inquire into the
elements of the <i>cost of production</i> of each of these three
classes of commodities; and we may find ourselves surprised
at the simplicity and certainty of these elements.</p>

<p><i>1.</i> We will now look into the Cost of Production of
valuable land-patches themselves, the first and most important
class of commodities. Here, as everywhere else in
Valuables, we discover certain free gifts of Nature, without
whose presence indeed the value could never come
into being, but which are not <i>constituents</i> of the value, because
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
they are gratuitous, given of God, and because the
natural competition among buyers and sellers inevitably
flings out from all effect on value of the otherwise possible
action of these free and bountiful gifts, as have been already
fully illustrated in chapter first. No piece of land ever
yet had one particle of Value until human efforts of some
sort had been expended on it or in some connection with
it, for two excellent reasons, first, no man would ever even
<i>think</i> of saying to another in reference to such a piece of
land "Give me something for it and I will pass it over to
you," and second, even if he did think of such an absurdity
the other would reply "Why should I give you anything
for something to which you have not the least claim,
especially as I can take for nothing just such pieces all
around here?" It must be remembered, not only that God
gave the whole earth to all mankind without distinction,
but also that his bountiful hand scattered all peculiar kinds
of patches in great number upon each of the Continents.
There is a plenty of Utility (gratuitous) in land-parcels
just as God made them, but no possibility of Value (onerous)
till other hands than His have touched and benefited
them.</p>

<p>What, then, are the onerous elements that enter into the
value of land-parcels and constitute their Cost of Production?
There are only two such elements, namely, <i>Cost of
Labor and Cost of Capital</i>. To find out exactly what
"Labor" is, and what there is in it entitling and assuring
its reward in "Wages," will be the task and perhaps also
the pleasure of the next chapter; but it will suffice for
the present discussion to say, that Labor is human exertion
put forth for the sake of a commercial return. Lands can
by no possibility be brought out of a state of nature into a
state of value without the expenditure of Labor; and the
actual or estimated cost of this labor, accordingly, is the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
first constituent of the Cost of Production of valuable
lands considered as Commodities. Labor, however, can
not apply itself to free lands in order to make them valuable
without the co-operation of another onerous element,
namely, Capital, in some of its many forms. For example,
if forest lands are to be made tillable, the trees must first
be cut down, and this will require besides the muscular
exertion of the laborer something in the way of an axe,
which is capital, the result of previous labor reserved to
assist in further production: if native prairie is to be subdued
to a valuable commodity, something of the nature of
a plough must be employed in the process, and horses or a
steam engine to propel it, and a plough and horses are
capital, and still require fresh labor to make them useful in
production. But capital always costs something; and,
therefore, the cost of the Capital enters in as a second constituent
into the cost of production of Land-Commodities.
But these two costs are all. We shall search in vain for
any other onerous element in the cost of producing commodities.
There are two variables only in the Cost of Production,
which itself is the sum of the two subordinate costs.</p>

<p>(a) And now let us analyze first the Cost of Labor in
this connection, and then second the Cost of Capital, and
we shall soon reach radical and unchangeable ground, and
find in the sum of these two an aggregate Cost of Production,
and also all of the variables that can ever enter into
such Cost. It is plain to reason, that only by Labor non-valuable
land-pieces ever did or ever can become valuable.
Captain John Smith understood this in 1607 at Jamestown
as well as anybody understands it now: there were
48 gentlemen, and only 12 tillers of the soil, among the 105
colonists, who originally landed there: "<i>nothing is to be expected
hence</i>," he wrote of the new country, <i>but by</i> "<i>labor</i>:"
new supplies of laborers, aided by a wise allotment of land-parcels
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
to each colonist, secured after five years of struggle
the lasting fortunes of Virginia: "<i>men fell to building
houses and planting corn</i>": the very streets of Jamestown
were sown with tobacco; and in fifteen years the colony
numbered 5000 souls.</p>

<p>Now the cost of Labor is analyzable into three variables
only, namely, (1) the <i>efficiency</i> of the labor; (2) the <i>rate</i>
of nominal wages paid; (3) the cost to the employer of
<i>that valuable</i>, in which the wages are paid. Let us see:
what an employer wants <i>is to get things done</i>; consequently,
if an employer hire two men to work for him at
the same rate of wages, and if one be twice as efficient a
laborer as the other, the <i>cost</i> of the labor of the first is only
one half the cost of the labor of the second: therefore, a
<i>high rate of wages</i> does not mean <i>a high cost of labor</i> whenever
and wherever the laborers are very efficient. As a
rule, it is found, that the cost of labor in reference to a
given product is <i>the least</i> in those countries, like the United
States and Great Britain, in which the rates of nominal
wages are <i>the highest</i>; because, it is found also, that a high
<i>efficiency</i> of laborers accompanies both as a cause and as an
effect high rates of wages.</p>

<p>Secondly, there are striking differences in the rates of
nominal wages paid for a day's work in the same general
employment in different parts of the same country, and
especially in different countries. The agricultural laborer
in the west of England, say in Wiltshire, gets about
10<i>s.</i> per week, while in the north of England, say Nottinghamshire,
laborers at the same general work get about
16<i>s.</i> per week. Walker in his Wages-Question gathers
from the best authorities many such statements as
these: "On the Grand Trunk Railway in Canada the
French-Canadian laborers received 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a day, while the
Englishmen received from 5<i>s.</i> to 6<i>s.</i> a day, but it was found
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
that the English did the greatest amount of work for the
money." "In the quarry at Bonnieres, in which Frenchmen,
Irishmen, and Englishmen were employed side by side, the
Frenchmen received 3, the Irishmen 4, and the Englishmen 6,
francs a day; and at those different rates the Englishman
was found to be the most advantageous workman of the
three." "The statistics of the iron industry in France
show, that on the average 42 men are employed to do the
same work in smelting pig iron as is done by 25 men on
the Tees." "In India, although the cost of daily labor
ranges from 4&#189;<i>d.</i> to 6<i>d.</i> a day, mile for mile, the cost of
railway work is about the same as in England." Thus it
is plain, that a <i>high rate of wages</i> does not import a
<i>high cost of labor</i>, but rather the reverse. A vast mass
of current fallacies are disposed of in a moment by this
truth seen in its grounds. The United States have shown
in the past the highest rates of nominal wages in the world,
and at the same time have shown the lowest costs of labor
to the employers, because as a rule the laborers here have
been more efficient than elsewhere. England has the
highest rates of wages and the lowest costs of labor in
Europe for the same reason. The degree of <i>efficiency</i>
shown by different laborers is the second variable in a cost
of labor.</p>

<p>Thirdly, if that valuable, whether money or other, in
which wages are paid, varies in cost to the employer, then
the cost of the labor paid for by that valuable, efficiency of
the laborers, and nominal rate of pay remaining the same,
will of course be varied thereby. We shall learn hereafter
in the chapter under that title, that the value of "Money"
is by no means invariable even in one country, just as we
have already learned the variable nature of all other
values; and, too, wages are not always paid in money,
though they are commonly reckoned in the terms of money;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
and accordingly, the third and last variable in a cost of
labor is the cost to the employer of that valuable, whatever
it be, in which the wages are paid. Assuming, as we may,
that given wages are paid in money, then any country that
has for any reason a more abundant money than another
may clearly pay higher rates of nominal wages than that
other without making its costs of labor any higher than in
that. The United States, for example, has usually had a
very abundant money (not always of the best kind), which
of course has tended to make higher the current prices of
all commodities, and this has enabled capitalist-employers
to pay higher nominal rates of wages, without at all
enhancing relatively the costs of labor, and also without
really benefiting the laborers.</p>

<p>(b) We will now analyze second the Cost of Capital in
this connection, as the only other element of cost in
the Cost of Production of Commodities in general, and
particularly now in the cost of making worthless land-pieces
valuable so as to be used in further production. Here too
we find three variables, no one of which can be safely
neglected any more than the other three in the reckoning
that has for its object a prospective cost of production.
These are, first, <i>the current rate per centum</i>; second,
<i>the time for which the capital is advanced</i>; and third,
<i>the liability of that form of capital to slow or rapid
wearing out</i>. For instance, under the first variable, the
rate per centum of capital, if the rate at Amsterdam
be 3 and that at New York be 7, if the cost of labor be
equal in the two cities, if the time of advance be one year,
and if there be no liability of the capital to wear out; then
any commodity made at Amsterdam with an outlay of $100
may be sold at a profit for $103, while a similar commodity
made at New York with the same outlay cannot be sold
for less than $107. All other things being equal, a <i>low</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
<i>rate per centum</i> of capital in any country gives that country
an advantage in the markets of the world for selling
its commodities over other countries offering similar
commodities where the rate is higher, because its cost of
their production is less. Of course also such a country
can subjugate its wild lands and make them valuable at
less cost than the other countries.</p>

<p>To illustrate the operation of the second variable, the
time for which the capital is advanced, let the same
suppositions be continued, except that the <i>time of advance</i>
at New York be extended to four years. Then the
commodity may be sold at and from Amsterdam, as before,
at $103, but the corresponding commodity at and from
New York for not less than $131, so far as mere cost
of production determines the prices. This point is also
well shown up in the case of wine, which, to reach its
perfection, requires to be kept a number of years, for, if it
be genuine and ripe, its cost of production has been by so
much enhanced by its delay in reaching the market. If
the time of advance be long, and the rate <i>per centum</i> high
at the same time, the cost of capital from the two causes
combined multiplies the cost of the product; and consequently,
only countries in which the <i>rates</i> are low can
successfully engage in enterprises requiring a large capital
to be invested for <i>long periods</i> before returns are realized.
One million of Dutch capital at 3% a year, expecting to
realize returns only after 20 years, may be remunerated by
products selling for $1,806,111; but American capital
under like circumstances, except that the rate here is 7%,
must have a return of $3,869,685, or lose by the operation.</p>

<p>To illustrate the action of the third and last variable, we
must observe, that all forms of capital wear out, but some
forms much faster than others, and that this makes a difference
in the sinking-funds that must be reserved out of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
the gross profits of the capital in order to replace the principal
whole. This difference will at once affect the cost
of capital, and so of production, and so indirectly the
ultimate value of the product. Suppose there are two
commodities, which we will call A and B, produced in
two different establishments, in each of which is invested
a capital of $11,000, in one of which is used a machine that
costs $1000 and is wholly worn out by one year's use, and
in the other a machine costing the same sum, which will
last, however, for ten years. Suppose further, that the rate
<i>per centum</i> of profit be 10, and the time consumed in completing
each of the two products be one year. Now there
is a marked difference in the Cost of Capital in the two
establishments, and this difference will indirectly but
immediately appear in the Value of the respective products.
For, to A must be charged not only $1100, the
interest on the whole capital at the current rate, but also
another $1000, wherewith to replace the machine already
worn out by a single year's use. A, accordingly, cannot
be sold without loss for less than $2100. B, however,
will cost less and can be sold for less at the usual profit.
Because, to it must be charged, as before, $1100, current
rate of profit on the capital invested, and only $100 (really
less than that for an obvious reason) to replace the durable
machine after ten years' use. The capitalist, therefore,
can sell B for $1200, and make something over the current
rate of profit.</p>

<p>Since the cost of capital invariably resolves itself into
these three variables, every capitalist in order to become
successful as such must give strict attention to all three of
these points. To any one who projects the making of
valueless into valuable land, or valuable into more valuable
land, by the expenditure of capital upon them for
that purpose, it becomes a matter of prime importance for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
him to inquire how long a time the whole process will
take, how much he must allow <i>per annum</i> for the cost of
all the implements employed, and especially how complete
in action and duration are these costly implements. The
<i>durability of machinery</i>, whatever the name it bear and
whatsoever the work it do, is at once the most significant
and the most neglected point in the actual and prospective
Production of our time and country; and no condemnation
can be too severe upon a policy of public law, such as now
prevails, whose whole tendency and actual effect is to
worsen the quality and lessen the durability of all commercial
implements whatsoever, from the needle to the
locomotive. The same abominable public policy increases
the cost and decreases the durability of all agricultural
implements, like the axe and the plough, designed and
adapted to transform valueless and non-productive into
valuable and food-producing lands.</p>

<p><i>2.</i> Now, having fully seen the elements of the cost of reducing
land itself from a natural into a valuable and productive
form, what next are the elements of the cost of
production of those material commodities produced for
sale <i>by the aid</i> of these subdued and now productive lands?
Commodities so produced constitute the second class in
the law of their Cost of Production. And a vastly important
class it is. The food of the world, so far as that
food is purchased as the product, whether animal or vegetable,
of valuable lands; the fuel of the world, so far as
that fuel is bought from owned and accessible forests and
mines; the clothing of the world, so far as the fabrics
come from the cultivated cotton and flax and wool and
skins offered for sale; the shelter of the world, so far as
the wood and brick and stones and lime are drawn from
valuable lands and quarries; and the warehouses and the
temples and the theatres of the world, built, as they are,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
out of the products of costly and rentful lands: these all,
and many more like these, constitute a class of commodities
immense in their volume, whose cost of production
has in it an element peculiar and additional to that of the
first class already analyzed, and to that of the third class
also soon to be considered.</p>

<p>This peculiar and additional element in the cost of production
of these things, class second of commodities, is
called <span class="smcap">rent</span>. Interminable have been and still are, especially
in the British Islands, the definitions and discussions
upon Rent: they have boxed the compass of economical
nomenclature: they have run up and down the entire
gamut of possible expression on such a theme. David
Ricardo, the Anglo-Jewish Banker, formerly announced,
near the beginning of this century, that "<i>Rent is that portion
of the produce of the earth, which is paid to the landlord
for the use of the original and indestructible powers of
the soil.</i>" Two objections lie with fatal weight against this
definition and all that is involved in it: first, there <i>are</i> no
"indestructible powers of the soil," either "original" or
acquired, since the universal verdict of all agriculture has
been and still is, that the "powers" of all soils are continually
wearing out, and need to be constantly renovated by
fertilizers and manipulations of all sorts; and second, even
if there were such "original and indestructible powers," it
would be impossible to separate them from the additional
"powers" acquired by means of the capital expended to
bring that land from the state of nature to its present
state, and the landlord has had nothing to do with any
"powers" of the land except those conferred by his own
labor and capital upon it, and can by no possibility put
himself into a position where he can <i>enforce</i> any claim of
his own for a return from any "original powers" of any
land-parcel whatever. The simple truth is, and it illumines
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
the whole subject of agriculture and its products,
that the value of land-parcels and also the value of the
transient use of them, or <i>Rent</i>, hang wholly on the onerous
human efforts involved in them, and not at all on original
and gratuitous utilities. Science has only to unfold the
plan of God and its actual and beneficent workings. "<i>In
the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread.</i>" All that God
furnishes to men in order to get a living and in order even
to get rich is Opportunity. The opportunity is ample.
The call to a partnership in Effort as between God and
men is loud and constant. The world with all its powers,
free lands with all their utilities, the change of seasons,
the blessed sun and the blessed dew and rain, the constant
disintegration of rocks beneath the soil and the gradual
clothing with lichens and moss and verdure of the rocks
above in preparation for a new soil, and the wonderful
chemistry of the vast laboratory of Nature, all work night
and day without fee or reward in the service of mankind.
But men themselves must not intermit their labor. All
values are of <i>their</i> creation and maintenance. If they
cease or relax their labor upon land-pieces so only made
valuable and rentful, then will the value and the rent begin
to slip away inexorably, and no prayers and no regrets
will avail to call them back.</p>

<p>Now, then, since commodities of the second class in the
cost of their production must respond not only to the <i>current</i>
cost of Labor and Capital in bringing them to market,
but also something additional in the way of Rent to the
<i>past</i> cost of the implement, the land-parcel, without whose
contributing agency present results could not be gained;
<i>Rent is the Rendering for the present use of a Valuable
made such by past Labor and Capital.</i> Land-parcels leased
for agriculture; mines and the access to them leased for
the production of metals and minerals; and forests whose
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
growth has been permitted by the past <i>abstinence</i> of their
owners; all properly yield a rent; because these forms of
capital, whose existence is due to past labor and capital,
are present contributors to products, whose sale must compensate
not only present labor and the use of current
capital, but also the use of these more permanent forms of
capital long ago created.</p>

<p>A competent authority estimated in 1881, that the land-parcels
of the United Kingdom of Great Britain were
worth £3,000,000,000; and there were at the same time
6,000,000 of inhabited houses, excluding factories and
business premises and tenements renting for £20 and
under. Most of these lands and houses are rented by
their owners to the actual occupiers on the just principle
explained above, inasmuch as the lease-system is the prevailing
one in that country. According to the Census of
1880, there were 4,008,907 so-called farms in the United
States in that year. Most of these are held in fee simple,
and are tilled by their owners; but just so far as land-patches
and forests and mines are leased in this country,
their products must provide in their price of sale for current
rents, as well as current costs of present production.
This is just as it should be, and just as it must be,
if Capital is to take this form of assisting the processes of
future production.</p>

<p>But this form of Capital, as well as all other forms of
the same, is perpetually wearing out, that is to say, is
gradually losing its power to contribute as at first to the
present and future processes of production. This loss is
in the very nature of things,&mdash;in the very nature of all
Capital. The great Father never intended that His children
should cease from work. He has ordered all things
so, that they cannot cease from work, and continue to live
in any comfort and progress. Value, as we have already
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
thoroughly learned, is not a quality that can be put into
anything <i>to stay there</i>: it is a recurring relation of mutual
services between man and man; and each of these services
of the three kinds involves recurring Efforts. Capital is
a form of Value; and, consequently, it cannot possibly
take on a shape not subject to the <i>law of diminishing
returns</i>. This is deductive proof. And precisely the
same result is reached by Induction. Men have noticed
and recorded the fact at all times, and have made provision
for it in their pecuniary calculations, that tools and
machinery need to be repaired and then replaced, that the
current interest on moneyed capital tends to decline from
generation to generation in all progressive countries, and
also that lands and other forms of real estate so lose their
productive and rental power unless cared for in renovation
that men migrate and emigrate in consequence.</p>

<p>How much Rent shall the tenant pay to the landlord for
the present use of the latter's old lands? Or in other
words, how much shall be added to the going price of the
product on account of the diminishing return due for the
use of the old landed capital? This is a hard question to
answer: probably the hardest question that is ever asked
in practical Economics. Mr. Gladstone wrestled with it
as complicated with a larger political question in passing
the Irish Land Bill of 1881. Another honest athlete, Mr.
Parnell, wrestled with it upon the same parliamentary
arena. Scores of able and practical statesmen in Great
Britain, and elsewhere, have struggled to reach a practical
answer to this question; and scores of able and theoretical
economists in all countries have striven to reach a theoretical
answer to it. Most of these answers have been inharmonious,
and many of them contradictory, with each other.
The Land Bill of 1881 created a parliamentary Commission,
whose duty and authority it was, to visit the Irish
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
counties in person, to gain information in detail, to take
sworn testimony of all the parties concerned, and then to
lift or lower rents according to their discretion. The
discontent of the Irish tenants in general was considerably
mollified by the action of this Commission; while the
debates and wrangles of the parliamentary session of 1889,
and the persistent agitations for Home Rule (an agitation
at once political and economical), show that the results of
the work of that Commission were not wholly satisfactory.</p>

<p>(a) It is easy enough to see why the solution of this
general problem is so extremely difficult. The new is
mixed in with the old. The result of the old labor and
capital is a productive piece of land; the current labor
and capital is expended upon the same piece to make it
more productive; the same sort of thing is done now that
was done then, and the results of the two are now thoroughly
intermixed; there were original free utilities in
soil and growths and deposits, but these had and have no
value and can never yield rent; the old labor and capital
improved the soil by clearing and drainage and fertilizers,
and made the growths and deposits more valuable and
accessible, so that even the old onerous was more or less
transformed into the original gratuitous; and now the
new onerous, the fresh cultivation and fertilization and
betterments generally, in soils and roads and buildings,
are inextricably commingled with former betterments of
the same general kind and with the original free gifts of
Nature. No wonder the Commission of 1881 found difficulty
in determining what was what and which was which!
No wonder that Irish tenants on long leases quarrel with
their landlords about the betterments, how much is new,
how much is old! It is clear, that when the lease is ended,
the landlord ought to compensate the tenant for all that
portion of the latter's betterments, which is not already
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
worn out; it is equally clear, that the tenant ought to be
willing to pay a fair rent for the use of the unexpended
betterments of the landlord and his predecessors; while
there is room and verge enough for endless disputes between
them as to the respective amounts of these, and consequently
as to the amounts of rent and of its remissions.</p>

<p>These difficulties and intricacies do not belong to the
<i>principles</i> of the Science of buying and selling, which are
in the main clear and certain in their action, but are
incidents of determining in certain cases <i>what that is</i>,
which is bought and sold. Parties in interest in all kinds
of buying and selling are sometimes compelled to go to
the courts in order to have the Law decide what their
respective rights are as buyers and sellers; but this is no
fault of Political Economy as a science, or of trading as
an art; two men in all cases make their own bargain,
according to their own estimate of the respective rendering
and receiving of each; if the uncertainties of language,
the misconception on the part of one or both of the
terms agreed upon, and the misapprehension of some of
the circumstances of the case, breed confusion and litigation,
all this cannot be justly charged to the science of
Political Economy.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, it is into these incidental intricacies and
uncertainties, that Henry George's now famous theory of
landed rents and the taxation of them, strikes its roots.
Instead of building his structure upon firm and open
ground, so that thoughtful men can see that his basis is
solid and scientific, Mr. George dashes at once into a
thicket and lays his foundations with quickness and assurance
where all is dark and doubtful, or at best where all is
rather incidental than fundamental and demonstrable, and
pretty soon displays a superstructure that appears attractive
both without and within, through whose airy halls
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
he knows how to conduct to their delight the credulous
and discontented, and on whose walls hang plausible pictures
calculated to invite and hold the attention of the
masses. Let the perfect integrity and rhetorical ability of
Mr. George be freely conceded; let it be freely conceded
also, that he teaches in his books and lectures a great deal
of vastly important industrial truth in a popular way so as
to accomplish great good, such, for example, as the imperative
need of greater simplicity in taxation, and the indisputable
right of the people to their liberty in buying and
selling; yet it must at the same time be owned, that he
has never yet found out exactly what <i>Value</i> is in general,
consequently what are the causes of value in lands, and
what are the nature and grounds of Rent. Something
more of patient and radical analysis at the outset, and of
logical and scientific unfolding afterwards, would have
made Henry George one of the chief benefactors of his
age.</p>

<p>(b) It is also very easy to see, that the current price of
produce, that is, what is gotten in return for the sale of
what is gotten out of the land-parcels, must have a dominant
influence upon what can be paid as rent for the use of
the parcels. Unless the return from the produce be sufficient
to reward at current rates the present labor and
capital employed upon the parcel, the parcel will not continue
to be cultivated at all, otherwise men would act
without a motive for action, which they never do; unless,
therefore, the price of produce be more than high enough
to repay current wages and profits, there will be nothing
left for Rent; and, consequently, the amount of the rent
that can continue to be paid for lands will be <i>the difference
between the going price of what is produced from them and
the current expenses of cultivating them</i>. Here, as everywhere
else within the domain of Exchange, Competition
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
exerts its beneficent action. If one dealer, or ten, endeavors
to put a price upon the produce more than enough to
pay current wages and profits with a fair margin for the
diminishing rate of rent, there are a plenty of others,
dealers in the same grade of produce, who will be content
with a fair return for present and past expenditure of
labor and capital; and the action of these will effectually
debar the others from exorbitant rates. The price of produce,
accordingly, under free competition, is the divinely
appointed regulator of landed rents. It regulates also,
though more indirectly, the current rates of wages and
profits in agriculture.</p>

<p>Very different from this is Ricardo's doctrine of Rent.
He makes everything turn on the Cost of Production of
the Produce, which is Effort, ignoring the ever-varying
demands for the produce, which is Desire. His doctrine,
too famous and too long received for us to pass by in this
connection, though now superannuated, was for substance,
this: there are some lands in every country whose produce
just repays the expenses of cultivation, and consequently
yields no margin for rent; and the cost of production on
these rentless and poorest lands under cultivation, will
determine the price of the produce; and as there can be
but one price in the same market, the produce raised on
more fertile land will be sold for the same price, and this
price, besides paying the cost of cultivation, will yield a
rent rising higher according as the land is more fertile;
so that the rent paid on any land is always a measure of
the excess of productiveness of that land over the least
productive land under paying cultivation; and therefore,
an increased demand for food in consequence of increased
population, and the higher price resulting, will force cultivation
down upon still poorer soils, or compel a higher
culture for less remunerative returns on the old soils,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
according to the law of diminishing returns, which in
either case will raise the rents on all the soils above that
grade that just repays the expenses of cultivation; so that
it is the sole interest of landlords, as such, that population
should be dense and food high, their interest being directly
antagonistic to that of the other classes of the community.</p>

<p>(c) Finally, in this connection, it is easy enough to see,
what were the motives on the part of the landlords, and
what were the results on the part of the masses, of Great
Britain, in putting on and keeping on the infamous Corn
Laws, so-called, which were repealed forever in 1846.
The Corn Laws forbade the importation of foreign cereals
under heavy pecuniary penalties. The simple purpose of
the landlords then governing England was to raise the
price of their grain by shutting off Competition of foreigners
by means of these prohibitory tariff-taxes. It was
Protectionism pure and simple. It was designed to raise
the price of bread to the masses of their countrymen, and
often did raise it to the point of their starvation. But we
have just seen, that the higher the price of the produce,
the wider the margin for Rent for the lands that produce
it. The Corn Laws of England enriched the landlords at
the expense of all other classes and to the starvation of
many of the poor. As has been well said, this was the
most successful of all the many expedients that have been
tried, "<i>to fertilize the rich man's land by the sweat of the
poor man's brow</i>." The words of Daniel O'Connell, spoken
Sept. 28, 1843, in his parliamentary fight against the high-tariff
Corn Laws, were surfeited with truth and righteousness:
"<i>But what is the meaning of 'Protection'? It means
an additional sixpence for each loaf; that is the Irish of it.
If the landlord had not the protection, the loaf would sell for
a shilling, but if he has protection, it will sell for one and sixpence.
Protection is the English for sixpence; and what is</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
<i>more, it is the English for an extorted sixpence. The real
meaning of 'Protection,' therefore, is robbery,&mdash;robbery of
the poor by the rich.</i>"</p>

<p>At the present moment and for twenty-five years past,
the public laws of the United States ostensibly relating to
Taxes, have had an immense influence upon the value and
rents of the agricultural lands of the country to depress
them; because these laws have put up nearly or wholly
impassable barriers to the coming in of those foreign goods,
against which the farmers would naturally and profitably
and inevitably have sold their surplus agricultural produce;
by destroying the foreign market for farm products, these
laws do in effect destroy a large part of the value of the
farms of the country, and of what would otherwise be the
rentals of a part of them; the Constitution of the country
expressly forbids any taxation whatever of Exports, but
these laws have precisely the same effect on the value of
farm products if they were themselves forbidden to be
exported, because those goods for which these would
be otherwise exchanged for a profit are forbidden to be
imported. <i>A market for products is products in market.</i>
Thus these wretched laws lower the price of farm products,
and consequently the value of farms and of their rents,
and impoverish the farmers who are nearly one-half of the
entire population of the country.</p>

<p>While these paragraphs are being written, comes the
intelligence of the formation of the "North American Salt
Company," whose purpose is in their own language "<i>to
unify and systematize the salt interests of the United States
and Canada</i>," and to this end "<i>arrangements have been completed
for the purchase and control of nearly all the existing
salt properties of the North American continent</i>." As this
is a fair instance out of some thousands, in which a tariff-tax
has the designed effect to lift or lower values which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
deeply concern the people, let us look at it for a moment.
On the average of the past twenty-five years the tariff-tax
on salt has in general doubled the cost of that necessary of
life to the whole people of the United States. When
Canada had no such tax, American makers of it sold salt
sometimes to the Canadians 40% less than they would sell
it to their own countrymen. On the basis of this United
States tariff-tax (it would never have been dreamed of
without it) this new company comes forward with a scheme
of international monopoly to control in their own interest
the price of a prime necessity of life. They propose to
issue stock and bonds to the amount of $15,000,000, with
which to buy up "the existing salt properties"; and they
frankly avow in the prospectus from which we are quoting,
that profits of $2,000,000 a year on their capital are justified
by the present outlook. Whence are these immense
profits to come? Out of the pockets of the masses of the
American people bound hand and foot in the meshes of a
legal monopoly, which they themselves allow themselves to
be ensnared in! In a similar but more outrageous way,
are bound up at the present moment in the secret so-called
"Trusts" about forty more of the necessaries of life; each
one of which, unless it be the "Standard Oil Trust," has
its footing in a so-called "protective" tariff-tax, and would
collapse instantly on the repeal of that!</p>

<p>It was necessary in order to complete our study of the
second class of material commodities, namely, those produced
from valuable and rentful lands, to glance in passing
at the frequently disturbing effect on these, aside from their
cost of production, of sinister laws plausibly imposed upon
an unsuspicious people in the interest and at the instance
of a privileged few.</p>

<p><i>3.</i> It only remains in this chapter, devoted to the discussion
of material Commodities in their three economic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
classes, to conclude with a glance at the third class, namely,
those material valuables that are obtained from free and
unowned sources, such as masts cut in the wilds of America
on both oceans two and three hundred years ago, and fish
caught on the Banks of Newfoundland, and furs gathered
to such profit in the north by the Hudson's Bay Company,
and salt evaporated in the tropics by a free sun from old
ocean's brine.</p>

<p>These, and all such things as these, have a cost of production
determined only by the cost of present labor and
capital, and consequently a grade of value determined only
by present Demand and Supply, unentangled for the most
part by questions of rent and prior claim and taxation and
nationality. All these things, accordingly, are relatively
cheap, except as the element of Scarcity, and on that
account of strong Desire, may sometimes come in to
enhance the value. No man can tell the time exactly
when French fishermen from the coasts of Brittany ventured
over to the Banks of Newfoundland in their frail
barks for the abundant cod in those waters, and went back
home again at the close of the season freighted with plenty
of a free and cheap food for their families and countrymen;
or when it was that rude men calling themselves English
followed these in their western track for the same general
purposes, to become thereby hardy seamen on deeper seas,
such as those who gained long afterwards the naval victories
of Nelson; and we have all read in the fascinating
pages of Irving the ventures and adventures of John Jacob
Astor, the attraction of free furs in the Northwest of
America, the hazards and the history incident to obtaining
them, and the immense profits gained by their sale in the
markets of the old world.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III.<br />

<small>PERSONAL SERVICES.</small></h2>


<p>There are three kinds of things only ever bought and
sold in this good world of ours. In the preceding chapter
we have conned carefully the first kind, material commodities,
in their three subdivisions of land-parcels and
products of such parcels and products of free land and
sea. In the present chapter we come to study the second
kind of valuable things, personal services, which we shall
also find subdivisible into three classes. We have treated
of Commodities first, because their value in its grounds
and changes is more easily understood than that of the
other two kinds, while in point of <i>time</i> Services might well
enough have been considered first, since it is these that
manipulate into value the originally rude forms of Nature.
The main difference between the two is this: in Commodities
the attention is naturally drawn to tangible
<i>things</i> offered for sale, such as lands and wheat and fish;
while in Services the attention is strongly drawn to <i>persons</i>
offering them for sale, such as the common laborer
and the skilled artisan and the professional artist. This
distinction, though obvious and useful as between commodities
and services, is not after all radical; because
Economics is a science of Persons from beginning to end;
inasmuch as the services precede and are merged in the
commodities, and inasmuch as the Desires (personal) of

<p>Personal Services are technically named <i>Labor</i> in the
science of Political Economy. This nomenclature is old
and familiar, and will probably always persist on that
account, but it is not of itself of the happiest, and it gives
birth to some ambiguities and many fallacies. Let us look
at these for a moment, before we pass to the definition and
discussion of what is commonly called Labor, but what is
better described by the term, Personal Services.</p>

<p>Contrast will help us a little here. Commodities can
always be measured by some <i>Standard</i> outside of themselves:
for example, land-parcels are measured into acres
and fractions thereof by a surveyor's compass and chain;
metals and cereals are weighed into centners and parts
thereof by scales of some sort; and sugar is not only
weighed at the custom-house, but tested as to other qualities
by the polariscope. Now land, wheat, sugar, and all
other commodities, have an existence separate from the
standards that measure them, and whether they are
bought or not they continue for a time essentially the
same. They exist <i>per se</i>. They were indeed brought
into existence on purpose to be sold, and if they cannot be
sold, similar things additional will not then and there be
brought into the market, but these things themselves are
there separate from the seller and separate from the buyer.
Not so with personal services. They do not exist <i>per se</i>.
They are not separate from the seller, and they cannot
come into existence without a buyer. <i>Skill</i> is something
the artisan cannot part with, nor can he sell the service to
which the skill gives rise till the buyer be present with
the return-service in his hands. The Laborer of any class
cannot put his "service" on exhibition, and then wait for
a buyer, as the commercial drummer sells goods by sample.
The doctor, for example, must have his <i>patient</i> before he
can show his skill. The buying and selling of personal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
services, accordingly, is more intimate and ultimate than
the buying and selling of commodities: it brings people
more closely together: it depends much more on traits of
<i>character</i> and on acquired <i>skill</i>.</p>

<p>Right here we may see clearly the main objection to the
term, "Labor," as commonly used, and the bad fallacy to
which it gives birth. "Labor" is indeed in form and
origin an <i>abstract</i> term as much as "service" is, with this
difference, that the word "service" radically implies the
person serving and another person served at the same
instant; but the term "Labor" has long been taking on
itself in the mouths of men a <i>concrete</i> meaning, as if it
might be something separate from the laborers, as in the
common phrase "Labor and Capital," which has already
done a world of mischief and is likely to do a good deal
more, because it seems to imply, that the two are alike
in independent self-existence, and that they stand over
against each other on equal terms for a fair bargain or
for a free fight. This is not the case, as we shall see more
fully later; since capital is something separable from the
capitalist, always a commodity or a claim, always transferable,
always valuable or else it will not be "Capital."
Some of the German economists, and particularly John
Conrad of Halle, have avoided this difficulty by a clean
nomenclature. They say "<i>Labor-givers</i>" and "<i>Labor-takers</i>,"
instead of Laborers and Capitalists, and especially
instead of "Labor and Capital," thus emphasizing the personal
element in both terms, and also leaving themselves
free to define and use the term "Capital" as distinct from
any particular capitalist, while the term "Labor" cannot
be defined and used as distinct from any given laborer.
This precise point, though probably new, is of very considerable
consequence in the true doctrine of Wages.</p>

<p>We are compelled by the exigencies of the English
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
language and the still stronger fetters of economical custom
to continue to use the terms "Labor" and "Laborers"
in their technical sense, and in connection with the scientific
terms "Capital" and "Capitalist"; but we shall
always use each of these words in the same meaning, and
free them as far as possible from the fungous accretions
that have fastened upon them in the course of time.</p>

<p><i>Personal effort of any kind put forth for another in view
of a return-service and for the sake of it is labor.</i></p>

<p><i>Laborers are persons rendering their peculiar services to
other persons for a commercial reward.</i></p>

<p><i>The valuable received by a laborer for his service rendered
is Wages.</i></p>

<p>These definitions exclude from our circle of view all
Efforts of anybody put forth for other than commercial
reasons; and they include all Efforts of everybody, from
the President to the scrub, put forth under the inducement
of a return-service or Wages. No good end seems
to be reached by trying to distinguish, as Francis Walker
does in his "Wages-Question," between the "Wages-class"
and the "Salary-class," because there appears to be no
scientific or other economical difference between Wages
and Salary. Each is a return-service for another service
rendered, and that is all there is to it. The whole class
of Laborers, accordingly, in any civilized and progressive
country, is immensely large and becoming constantly
larger. Excluding, of course, from this class all persons
in so far as they render so-called moral services to others,
which are in their very nature <i>free</i>, such as those that
spring from duty and courtesy and benevolence, and these
happily are also an immense and fast-augmenting class,
though our Science has nothing to do with them directly,
the number of those persons in every community and in
every rank of every community, who sell personal services
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
of some sort in distinction from commodities and credits,
is pretty nearly as large as the <i>per capita</i> population of
adults and competents within that circuit. It must be
borne in mind, that the same persons whose primary business
it may be to sell commodities or credits, often sell
services also in some subordinate or incidental way; and
also, that the same persons, who are dispensing on the one
hand their gifts and moral renderings freely, are frequently
of the busiest in selling on the other hand their
personal services for pay. In other words, the sellers of
Services cannot be discriminated <i>as to their persons</i> from
other sellers, or even from downright <i>givers</i>; but the <i>action</i>
itself, and the law of it, is quite distinct in the three cases
of selling, and utterly diverse in the one case of giving.</p>

<p>Now, can we sub-classify within this vast class of service-sellers,
so as to help us understand better the class as
a whole, and so especially as to help us understand better
the Law of Wages within the entire class? We have just
criticised Walker in a friendly spirit for attempting to
draw lines of demarcation within this wide field: can we
draw any useful ones ourselves less open to criticism than
his, and such as rest back upon fair differences in nature
and form? Walker makes his distinctions turn on certain
peculiarities in the return-services: can we make ours turn
better and clearer on certain peculiarities in the services
themselves? We can at least try. Hard and fast lines
cannot be drawn here, we admit. The exterior lines
around Commodities and around Services and around
Credits are each sharp and firm; and so is the deep-fixed
circle that includes all three of these alike as Valuables;
but <i>within</i> the smaller circles the lines of needful division
are somewhat more shadowy, though we leave with confidence
to competent Economists the triple lines but just now
drawn within the sphere of material Commodities.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>A rude classification among "Laborers," then, yet one
useful and indeed indispensable, may be made into
(1) Common Laborers, (2) Skilled Laborers, and (3) Professional
Laborers.</p>

<p>Common Laborers are those, whose services may be
acceptably rendered by an ordinarily competent person
after a little patient practice and instruction, without anything
corresponding to an <i>apprenticeship</i> as a preliminary
to their selling their service. Farm hands, teamsters, porters,
waiters, miners, 'longshoremen, railroad laborers, and
many more belong to this first class. Owing to the ease
with which this class can be recruited at any time from
growing boys and emigrating foreigners and from those
who may have essayed the class above and fallen back, the
Supply here is kept constantly large relatively to the
Demand for such services, and consequently Wages are
always the lowest and steadiest in this lowest class of
Laborers.</p>

<p>Skilled Laborers are those, who have had to pass through
something equivalent to an apprenticeship in order to be
able to offer their services for sale. These, as a class, present
some considerable points of difference from common
laborers. Their numbers are fewer, for the reason, that
relatively few parents can afford to give their children the
time and money needful for them to learn a trade, or to
become skilful in any art requiring prolonged education;
as a result of this lessened press of competition among
themselves, and because being intelligent and consequently
mobile they are able to insist better on their claims and
distribute themselves to points where their services are in
more demand; and because they are likely to be subject to
a stronger Demand than common laborers, on account of
the close connection of their services with special accumulations
of Capital; the Wages of skilled laborers will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
infallibly rule higher than those of common laborers.
Artisans in general constitute this second class of laborers.</p>

<p>Professional Laborers are those, who have received a
technical education,&mdash;something more than an apprenticeship,&mdash;expressly
to fit them to render difficult and delicate
services to their fellow-men for pay, and who possess
besides the requisite character and talents and genius to
enable them to succeed. Clergymen, physicians, lawyers,
literary men, artists, actors, and many more, render professional
services loosely so-called. The obstacles at the
entrance of this path occasioned by the lack (1) of appropriate
natural gifts, or (2) of the requisite industry and
character, or (3) of the means of suitable education and
training, practically exclude so many persons, that the
competition in the higher walks of professional life is not
such as to prevent a very large remuneration for services
rendered. The demand for these is often peculiarly intense,
as well as the supply peculiarly limited. When great
interests of property, of reputation, of life, are at stake,
it is felt that the best men to secure these must be had at
almost any price. Fees and rewards for services of great
delicacy, of great difficulty, of great danger, are paid by
individuals and corporations and nations without grudging.
Comparatively few men reach the highest points of
excellence in their respective professions, and they have in
consequence a natural monopoly in these fields of effort,
and receive for their labor a very high rate of Wages.
For example, Daniel Webster often took a fee of $1000
for a single plea in court; Paganini, a like sum for an
hour's playing on a violin; and Jenny Lind, at least as
much for an evening's singing in a concert, because there
was in each case a strong demand for a peculiar service
and only one person in the world who could render that
service in the circumstances to the same perfection. But
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
the objections which lie with such force against artificial
monopolies, cannot be urged at all against a natural monopoly;
for, if the road to excellence be open to all, and no
artificial obstructions thrown in the way of any, there is
no blame but rather praise for him who distances all
competitors, and asks and receives for services of peculiar
excellence a large remuneration. Exchange rejoices in all
diversities of advantage that are the birth of freedom, but
reprobates with all her force advantage that is gained by
artificial restrictions, because artificial restrictions always
infringe on somebody's right to render services for a
return; and the right to render services for a return is the
fundamental conception in the Right of Property.</p>

<p>Is it open for us, to gain a somewhat deeper and clearer
sense of <i>what that is exactly</i> that is rendered in these three
classes of personal Services, before we pass to the considerations
which determine in all cases their Value? It is
plain, that what common Laborers sell for the most part,
if not exclusively, is <i>muscular exertion</i> of some kind,
guided by the mind as trained in habit, and aided by
appropriate implements, all designed to meet the desire
and so call forth the return-service of the purchaser; it is
equally plain, that skilled Laborers with scarcely any more
exceptions than before sell the same sort of physical exertions,
or motions, this time guided by mental action of a
higher grade and wider scope, and aided also by more
elaborate tools working towards the desires and consequent
returns of a set of buyers more scrupulous and exacting
than the first set; and it is plain enough, that some of the
highest professional services, for instance the surgeon's,
though not by any means the mass of such services, are
essentially of the same kind as the two former, namely,
muscular motions, guided by the most intimate and exact
knowledge of things, and aided too by instruments the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
most scientific and expensive. In many of the professional
services the physical element sinks to a minimum, while
the intellectual and moral factors come to the front and
take up the chief attention; it will be found, however, that
the physical factor is always present in some degree, as,
for example, in the counsel's plea before the court, and in
the physician's visit on his patient; and in almost all cases,
if not in all, some implement or other plays its part in the
process of professional service before it ends, as Cicero
used a pitch-pipe or tuning-fork to gauge his voice in his
great pleas for Roman clients.</p>

<p>Precisely what is rendered, then, in all cases of Personal
Services in each of their three loose kinds, is <i>muscular
motion conjoined with mental effort and both these assisted
by habit and by some form of what we call Capital</i>. The
Services are therefore <i>Personal</i> in the highest sense. The
Mind and Body of the Laborer conspire to render them.
The most sagacious animal can never be trained to render
one of them. They are wholly <i>human</i>. Nevertheless the
muscular part in the rendering&mdash;motion and resistance to
motion&mdash;is just what tools and machinery can be made
to take the place of in large measure but never in whole
measure, because tools may not be taught <i>to think</i>. It
may seem sometimes as if machinery were about to take
the place of human hands in some classes of Production;
but it will be found in the ultimate issue, as it has been
found in every stage of the process, that human hands and
human minds in action are absolutely essential at every
point of the Exchanges among men. Men are so made
and Society is so organized, that they need increasingly for
their comfort and progress the personal services of their
fellow-men, and can render their own in exchange for
these; and consequently, there never can fail (under
freedom) a <span class="smcap">Market</span> for Personal
Services of the three kinds.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>Having now seen as closely as possible what that is
which is rendered in personal services, let us pass to the
principles which determine their remuneration. That is,
we will now inquire carefully into the Value of personal
services. We have learned already, that Demand and
Supply in their action and reaction upon each other determine
in all cases the value of Commodities for the time
being; and we shall find it to be equally the dictate of all
reason, and the outcome of all experience, that Demand
and Supply decide too in all cases on the value of all Services
and all Credits then and there. Shall we look first at
the considerations that issue in the Demand for personal
services, and then at those other considerations that limit
the Supply of them?</p>

<p>1. Demand is never the mere desire for anything, but
desire coupled with the ability to pay for it at rates satisfactory
to the present holder. The Demand for Services,
therefore, is made by the prospective purchasers of them;
and the purchasers, of course, are those who desire them
and are willing to pay for them at current rates. It will
be easiest and surest for us to study the Demand for Services
in each of the three classes of them in succession.</p>

<p>(1) The Demand for Common Laborers has several
points of difference from that for Skilled, and from that
for Professional, Laborers. It is scarcely ever intense.
It is mostly disconnected from large accumulations of
Capital. The desire is usually for immediate gratification,
without any other end in view. It is frequently for such
a service, as, if a renderer may not be conveniently and
cheaply found, one is inclined to do for himself. For
instances: if the barber be not accessible and reasonable
and tolerably skilful, a man will certainly shave himself,
provided he have not yet attained the independence and
the luxury of wearing a full beard; and the ordinary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
housewife, if the cleanly and tractable domestic does not
come into sight, will do her own work with casual assistance.
It is this important fact, that common services
among men and women in common life may in many cases
be dispensed with altogether, and in many other cases substitutes
be found for them, in connection with the other
important fact, that common laborers learn their art quickly
and easily, and consequently are present everywhere in
large numbers, that makes the Wages of such laborers
uniformly low. The Demand is moderate and the Supply
is large.</p>

<p>(2) The Demand for Skilled Laborers is steadier and
stronger than for Common, because in general the desire
for these is not for immediate gratification, but for an ultimate
satisfaction to arise from the commercial coöperation
of these laborers with their employers, who are capitalists,
in connection with accumulations of capital, the end in
view being the production of commodities for sale at a
profit. Here comes in a new motive on the part of capitalists
to buy the personal services of laborers. The motive
is simple and intelligible and commendable, but its nature
and operation is popularly and grossly misapprehended.</p>

<p>Capital is the result of Abstinence from the present
use of a Valuable in gratification, for the sake of a future
increase of it through Production. But Abstinence is
always irksome in itself. It must have its prospective
reward in an increase, a profit, or it will never transform
itself from a mere valuable into a capitalized product.
Now, the owner of the valuable, having transformed it
into capital from this motive, is under a commercial necessity
to hire laborers, in order by their help to make his
capital yield a profit. Capital lying idle decreases in <i>value</i>
even, to say nothing of its yielding no increase to itself;
and the motive of the capital-owner, accordingly, is strong
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
and constant to buy the services of laborers, to marry
these services with his own capitalized products, and thus
to produce commodities for sale, whose value shall be
greater than the present value of the capital and the services
combined. Here we reach in the minds and motives
of a large class of men an ultimate Demand for laborers,
and specially for skilled laborers, which is as true and
constant to its legitimate end of Profit as the needle is
true and constant to the pole.</p>

<p>At this point it is very evident, that, if the fair expectation
of the capitalists be realized in a steady profit, and
the larger the circle of capitalists and the more of capitalized
products to each the better for all concerned, the
Demand for laborers will become steady, and will be likely
to steadily increase, because there will then be a constant
motive on the part of all capitalists as such to put back a
part or all of their yearly profits into capitalized products,
and thus the Demand for laborers will become more
intense, and the rates of Wages so far forth must be
enhanced. The steady Demand for the services of the
laborers hinges upon the steady Profits of the capitalists,
and there is no antagonism between the interests of these
two classes of buyers and sellers, but rather a complete
identity of interest between them.</p>

<p>We are looking now solely at what constitutes the
Demand for laborers of the second class. As always, so
here, there is Desire first and then a ready Return-service.
The Desire of employers of this class is for a Profit on
their capital, and the return-service for the laborers is present
as a part of these capitalized products. This part of
the capital we call Wages-Portion. It is already in hand
or provided to be in hand when the wages fall due. Of
course it is expected, that the current wages will ultimately
come out of the current joint-production of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
laborers upon the capitalized products set apart for that
purpose by the capitalist. But if the profits fail to the
capitalists at the end of that industrial-cycle, whether it
be two months or twenty-four, then Desire will fail or be
weakened to hire laborers for the next cycle, and the
return-services or Wages-Portion with which to pay them
for another cycle will be lessened of necessity. Both elements
in Demand are curtailed by the falling-off of Profits.
There is at the same instant less desire to buy services and
less ability to pay for them. It is of the very nature of
capitalized products to wear out in the process of production;
if there be not net profits at the end of the cycle for
the capitalists, it shall go hard but there will be less wages
for the laborers during the next cycle. This is not a matter
of sentiment or of philanthropy, but of eternal law,
which God has ordained and the devices of men cannot
frustrate. Capitalists and laborers are joint partners in
the same concern. Under industrial and commercial freedom
their interests are identical. Both are buyers and
sellers to each other at the same instant; and, as always
when both parties are alike benefited and satisfied with a
trade, both will cheerfully and profitably continue the connection.
The Demand of each class for the product of
the other will continue unabated. Profits and wages reciprocally
beget each other.</p>

<p>But still it is not altogether true, what has sometimes
been stated by economists, that capitalists are under the
same sort of pressure to buy their services as the laborers
are to sell them. Capital is a Valuable already created by
the mutual desires and efforts of two persons, and is now
the exclusive property of one of them, and has also been
set apart by him through an act of will to be thereafter an
aid to some future production under the motive of a new
value to accrue thereby. The capital has now become secondary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
to and separated from the person who owns it. He
very seldom understands the real nature and operation of
it. He commonly imparts to it in his imagination a more
substantive and persistent existence than it actually possesses.
He is frequently more or less stuck up as towards
his neighbors and employees in consequence of his possession
of it. The very fact that he has capitalized it for
future operations shows that he is independent of it as a
means of present livelihood. The personal services of the
laborers, on the other hand, stand in very different relations
to <i>them</i>. Their personal services may indeed be <i>valuable</i>,
but they cannot be <i>capitalized</i>. As laborers they have
nothing else to sell. Unless they sell their services now,
these have no existence even, still less can they have any
value. It is only by a mischievous figure of speech, that
the skill of laborers is sometimes spoken of as their "Capital."
Therefore, the laborers are under a certain remote
yet inherent disadvantage as sellers of their personal services,
when compared with the capitalists as buyers of
them. This disadvantage, however, though apparent in
the nature of things, and under certain circumstances disastrous
to the laborers, may disappear practically under
another and natural state of things; and it is every way
to be desired by both classes alike that it should disappear
in practice.</p>

<p>Whenever there is a broad and constant and profitable
market for all the commodities the capitalists and the
laborers can jointly produce,&mdash;that is to say, whenever
profits are steady and remunerative and wages are high
and growing in their purchasing-power,&mdash;the Demand for
skilled laborers must always be such as puts the laborers
on a footing of equality as over against the capitalists,
because under such circumstances the purchasers of services
are many and eager, two bosses will be likely to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
bidding for one skilled laborer, and then wages are always
growing in dollars and each dollar growing in effective
purchasing-power.</p>

<p>It is of the last importance in this connection to notice,
that everything in Profits and Wages turns in the last
resort upon the breadth and freedom of <span class="smcap">Markets</span>. It is
out of the return-service received from the <i>sale</i> of the
commodities produced jointly by the capitalists and laborers,
that both wages and profits must ultimately be paid.
There is no other possible source of them. When the
Market fails, everything fails that leads up to a market.
Particularly fails the Demand for laborers for the next
industrial cycle, and of course drops also the prospective
wages for that cycle. The public folly and universal loss
of shutting off foreign markets for our own commodities
by lofty tariff-barriers, as has been conspicuously done by
the United States for thirty years past, follows of course
from this radical truth; and the Wages of laborers, instead
of being lifted by tariff-taxes, as has been so often falsely
and wickedly asserted, are inevitably <i>depressed</i> by them,
because they effectually forbid to capitalists and laborers
their best and freely chosen <i>markets</i> for the sale of their
joint products.</p>

<p>Another vastly important matter, constantly affecting
the Demand for laborers of the second class, is the Competency
or otherwise of the practical managers of the
Capital invested in industrial enterprises. Capital cannot
manage itself. It is of itself wholly inert. It is always
either a Commodity or a Credit. Conscious of their inability
to handle wisely their own bits of Capital, or else
taught it through a bitter experience, by far the larger
number of individual owners of it loan it to others to
manage; they invest it in some industrial corporation, in a
bank or a mill or a railroad. Some one person, or at least
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
a small body of persons, must practically manage now all
specific accumulations of capital. It is they in their
capacity of manipulating-capitalists, who constitute in
large measure the Demand for laborers. But such managers,
who are at once skilful and long-headed and honest,
do not grow upon a chance bush. They are rare. Most
of them in this country at least have been those, who
started in a small way in the control of their own earned
or small-inherited properties, and rose through practice
and knowledge and conscience to the ability to handle
profitably to all concerned large masses of Capital. In
the hands of such men, given a tolerable chance by public
law and private circumstances, both Profits and Wages
are sure to come in satisfactorily. They are Captains of
Industry. They are an honor to human nature. They
are a blessing to the whole community. They have no
need and no will to ask to be bolstered up in their business
by unjust taxes enforced upon a whole people.</p>

<p>Such men sometimes have sons or <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">protégés</i>, who possess
similar capacities and similar integrity, and these by experience
become able to carry on the business to similar
successful issues. This is happy, but it is unusual. More
commonly, in the second, and pretty certainly in the third,
generation, the line of royal succession fails. There comes
in a lieutenant rather than a captain of Industry. Likely
enough he mistakes the nature of capital, and thinks that
it will go along of itself without that eternal vigilance
that is the one price of its maintenance and increase;
likely enough he lacks the touch and rule of men, and his
laborers become demoralized and refractory; more likely
still he thinks he sees other operators around him getting
quicker rich by speculating in enterprises outside the
legitimate business, and takes some of his own and of
what is not his own and throws it out of its proper channels;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
and, as the result of one or all of these, things soon
go wrong, profits and wages fall off, poor work is done
and finds slow sale, and Demand for laborers (which is
their life-blood) slackens or goes out in that establishment.
No wonder the Paper-makers in their annual gathering at
Saratoga of 1889, resolved as the main outcome of their
meeting, that they would bring up their sons (or somebody's
sons) to succeed them in their business by a thorough
practical training in the paper-mill itself, beginning
early and continuing long. Industrial higher education in
this or some other form is the secondary hope of manufacturing
business in the United States, the primary hope
being in a decent commercial liberty to buy their supplies
and to sell their products in the best markets wherever
these are to be found.</p>

<p>There is one other important item that bears directly
upon the Demand for laborers of the second class, and
consequently upon their Wages, namely, the constant
introduction of more and better Machinery. At first blush
it would seem, and it has often been stated so, that the use
of machinery takes just so much work from human hands,
reduces by so much the Demand for laborers, and tends to
lessen by so much their wages. All this is the opposite of
the truth; but before we explain <i>why</i> it is the opposite
of the truth, let us attend carefully to the truth itself, as
stated in 1889 by the highest living authority on these
special points, Sir Edwin Chadwick, the octogenarian
pioneer in sanitary and economic reforms. Fifty-six years
ago Chadwick joined with his colleagues of the English
Factory Inspection Board in recommending reduced hours
of labor and other improvements which have now become
general in England. In a paper recently read before the
Political Economy Club, he calls attention to the greatly
increased production which follows improved machinery
and shortened hours.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p>He says: "<i>Spinning machines which formerly turned
8000 in a minute, now turn 11,000; and in Lancashire not
more than half the hands are now employed to produce the
same amount with new machinery as were employed on the
machinery of 1833. As an example of the extent of the reduction
of hands by these improvements, it may be mentioned
that one large family of cotton spinners in Manchester, which
40 years ago employed 11,000 hands, could not now muster
one half that number.</i> <span class="smcap">Yet the mill population has
increased, as well as the general population, the
hands discharged being absorbed in other employments.</span>
<i>At the beginning of the century the cost of spinning
a pound of yarn was a shilling. The pound of that
same yarn is now spun for a half-penny by hands earning
double wages for their increased energetic attention and skill.
It is now found, however, that the strain of the increased
responsible attention cannot be so long sustained as the slow,
semi-automatic pace by the old working of the old mills with
the long hours. Hence there is a tendency to a further voluntary
reduction of the working hours in the best mills, first
to nine hours. In one mill, in which 2000 men are employed
a voluntary reduction has been effected to about eight hours
with a more equable production; and I have heard of other
examples. As showing the cost of working with inferior
hands and loose regulations, a recent report from the Manchester
Chamber of Commerce states that 20s. worth of bundled
yarn may be produced at a cost of from 2d. to 3d. per
pound less in Manchester than in Bombay, notwithstanding
the hours of working are 80 hours per week, while in Manchester
they are only 50. At the present time Lancashire,
with its short hours, will meet Germany or any other country,
in neutral markets, in the world. In Germany the spinners
and weavers still work 13 hours a day as they once did in
England; France has only come down to 12 hours; whereas</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
<i>the English rate has long been 10 hours, and may soon be 9
or even 8. And this reduction improves the health of the
wage-workers, while the reduced cost of production allows
them higher wages; yet Germany with its long hours and
high tariff maintains a system</i> <span class="smcap">of low pay, dear production,
high cost of distribution, and limited sales</span>."</p>

<p>The accuracy of these important statements of fact is
confirmed on every hand. Committees of British spinners
and weavers have repeatedly visited the United States, and
then reported to their fellows at home, that wages, all
things considered, were equal for spinners and weavers in
Great Britain and the United States, and in some cases and
respects higher in the former. Many times before his late
lamented death, John Bright publicly testified that wages
in England during his parliamentary life had risen in
general 50%, and in some of the manufacturing lines 100%.
A few months before these statements of Chadwick were
made, Sir Richard Temple reported to his section of the
British Association, "<i>That the average earnings per head in
the United Kingdom, taking the whole population without
division into classes, is £35, 4s., and exceeds the average of
the United States, which is £27, 4s., and of Canada, which
is £26, 18s., and of the Continent, which is £18, 1s.; while it
falls below that of Australia, which is £43, 4s. per head.</i>"</p>

<p>According to this, the average earnings in Great Britain
per head of the population are 30% higher than in the
United States, and 81% higher than on the Continent
of Europe. Truly, Britain is a prosperous and profitable
country so far as average earnings of the whole people
by the year is concerned. Sir Richard goes on in the
same statistical paper to show, that the average annual
profit on British Capital is 14%, and that Capital yields
about the same rate for the United States.</p>

<p>Now, can we easily give the grounds on which the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
introduction of more and better machinery, instead of
displacing laborers, tends to lift and actually does lift the
wages of those concerned, who continue to work with their
hands and heads? We will try it.</p>

<p>(a) It takes the hands and heads of laborers to invent
and construct and keep in repair the machinery itself, that
is often supposed to displace laborers, and so far forth
opens a vent for the more profitable employment of some
of the laborers, who before performed the cruder and more
repetitive and automatic parts of the processes, which
parts alone machinery can be made to perform.</p>

<p>(b) Machinery always lessens the cost of a given amount
of production, otherwise there would be no motive for its
introduction. But, other things being equal, the lessened
cost of a commodity broadens the market for its sale.
The cheaper a useful commodity is offered, the more the
buyers of it the world over. The more and the better
the machinery brought in, the more and the cheaper
the commodities produced and the broader and better the
markets to be supplied; and, therefore, the more and
the more skilful the hands needed to tend the machinery
and to market the products.</p>

<p>(c) The more commodities thus created by men and
machines, and the wider the markets found for them over
the earth, the more laborers are required to extract and
prepare and transport the raw materials for the now
augmenting commodities, and also to ship and distribute
the finished products. As Chadwick says, notwithstanding
the strictly <i>factory</i> hands have diminished one half in one
place, "yet the <i>mill</i> population has increased, as well as
the general population, the hands discharged being absorbed
in other employments."</p>

<p>(d) These improvements in machinery, and the consequent
refinements in the skill of the laborers, cheapen also
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
of course the commodities consumed by the laborers
themselves, and therefore a given rate of wages, to say
nothing of a rate sure to enlarge under these circumstances,
now secures for the laborers a higher grade of comforts.</p>

<p>More and better and more durable machinery, consequently,
so far forth, tends at once to enhance the rate of
laborers' wages and increase the purchasing power of the
unit in which wages are paid.</p>

<p>To return now to the main line of discussion under the
present head, we have shown by proof positive that there
is nothing either in new machinery introduced, or in higher
wages paid in connection with such machinery, or in
shortened hours made possible by these two, to lessen the
Demand of Capitalists for the personal services of Laborers;
because, there is nothing in all these, commercial and
industrial freedom being presupposed, to lessen the Profits of
the Capitalists, which profits are the sole motive actuating
them as such. That high wages and short hours are rather
an advantage to Profits in connection with skilled laborers
and fine machinery, than a disadvantage when compared
with long hours and low pay and poor implements, is
clearly shown by Chadwick in the passage quoted comparing
England with English Bombay, where the working hours
are 60% more and the wages greatly less and the cost of
the machinery very little; "twenty shillings' worth of
bundled yarn may be produced at a cost of from 2<i>d.</i> to
3<i>d.</i> less in Manchester than in Bombay"; call it 2&#189;<i>d.</i> less;
that is, it costs the Bombay spinner more than 1% per
pound of yarn more to spin it than it costs the Manchester
spinner! For truth and decency's sake, then, let us have
done with the gabble in this country about the advantages
of "pauper labor" over skilled, of low wages over high,
of cheap machinery over dear!</p>

<p>The penetrating reader will perceive, that the root of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
this whole matter lies in the breadth and quickness of the
<i>Markets</i>, in which the commodities produced by the laborers
and capitalists may be sold against other commodities, and
against Services and Credits; if the markets of the world
are free to all to buy in and to sell in, which seemingly two
things are precisely one and the same thing, then the Demand
of Capitalists for the services of laborers to create and
market salable commodities wherever these may be wanted,
can apparently never slacken on the whole; because, the desires
of men which the efforts of other men may satisfy commercially,
are indefinite in number and unlimited in degree;
and, therefore, the Wages of the skilled laborers, the commercial
freedom of the nations being presupposed, are likely
to be on the whole on a steady rise throughout the world;
and the amount and excellence of the machinery on a
similar rise, since Capitalists can always under these circumstances
see their Profits looming up ahead of them,&mdash;the
profits of an endlessly diversified and marketable Production.</p>

<p>The chief reason at any rate, and almost the only reason
in common sight, why little England has surpassed in
commercial prosperity of every sort every other nation on
the globe during the past forty years, as evidenced by
these statistics of Sir Richard Temple and other abounding
proofs on sea and land, is in the fact, that her statesmen
of the last generation came to perceive clearly, and then
helped the people to see, that a market for products is products
in market; that her traditional tariff-barriers to keep
foreign goods out kept in equally domestic goods that
wanted to get out for a profit, and so down went the tariff-barriers
little by little, accursed alike by God and Englishmen,
never to be set up again around the shores of the land
of Cobden and Bright and Elliott; and to-day we read, that
the average annual Earnings per head of the entire population
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
of the United Kingdom, men and women and children,
English and Irish and Scotch, are $176, while the
annual average Profits of Capital within the three kingdoms
is 14%.</p>

<p>(3) In the last place here, we must now look at the
Demand for the personal services of Professional laborers.
These are persons, who have done something more with
reference to their life-work than serve an apprenticeship to
a trade, or acquire some mechanical skill in connection with
some kind of machinery. An Education rather than an
Apprenticeship is implied in Professional laborers. Knowledge
of the bodies and of the minds of men; acquaintance
with some one section at least of the general laws that pervade
the universe; some confidence (the more the better)
in God, who created and governs the world; are all requisite
to a reasonable success on the part of Professional laborers.
The Demand for their services, and of course also the
Return made to them for such services, will largely depend
on such superior knowledge and confidence acquired by
such persons, and involved in their services. Clergymen,
physicians, lawyers, statesmen, literators, actors, teachers,
and scientific experts, may serve as our chief examples of
Professional laborers.</p>

<p>(a) "All that a man hath will he give for his life."
When men fall sick, or those fall sick who are dear to them,
they send for the doctor. Scarcely any trait of human
nature is more universal than this. And the trait puts
honor on human nature, because it implies a relatively
high estimate of the worth of life in the mind of the
patient, and also a relatively high confidence in a certain
class of one's fellow-men. As Society progresses, and as
Christianity deepens the sense of the worth of the individual
life, and knits a stronger tie of confidence between
man and man, a change is slowly coming over the relations
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
between physicians and their patients; people do not
wait to fall sick before they send for the doctor, so much
as they formerly did; some individuals and families are
establishing connections with a medical adviser, who
studies their constitutions and habits of life beforehand,
guides them in general sanitation, and thus both he and
they are better ready for curatives in times of illness.
Gladstone has long had such an attendant, with the best of
results as he thinks, and strongly commended such action
to John Bright, but too late to save the latter from what
was thought to be premature death in consequence of imprudent
and ill-advised handling of his health. In a few
cases in England and the United States an annual salary
is paid a physician for general care of the family's health,
whether sickness befall or not, instead of the more usual
fees on consultation and attendance. Dr. Munn of New
York receives such an annual salary from Mr. Jay Gould.
But in whatever way medical services are paid for, the
Demand for them is constant and intense. The motive to
buy them is immediate and personal, not mediate and
remote, as in the case of capitalists and laborers of the
second class.</p>

<p>It is to be noticed further in respect to physicians, and
indeed in respect to all professional laborers much more
than in respect to other laborers, that much knowledge
has been gained by them for its own sake, out of pure love
for it, rather than for the sake of merely selling their services
as laborers; while this does not diminish in the least
the commercial character of their services, it tends to
beget on the part of the buyers of them a stronger confidence
in the men who render them, so that the Demand
for such services and consequently the pay for them is
enhanced by the trust reposed in the laborers on the ground
of something acquired by them for other than selling purposes,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
and which indeed <i>cannot be sold</i>; and superior <i>character</i>
also, as well as superior knowledge, which is wholly
<i>moral</i> in its basis and not mercantile at all, affects the
Demand for the services of the possessor of it to increase it,
on the ground of a naturally stronger trust in him as a professional
laborer, and at the same time tends to increase
his Wages by limiting the circle of those who can offer in
competition such services on the background of such superior
knowledge and character.</p>

<p>(b) Lawyers do not meet such a universal Demand in
the nature of things as do physicians. Said Jonathan
Smith of Lanesborough in the Massachusetts Convention
of 1788: "We have no lawyer in our town, and we do
well enough without." Still, one hundred years after that
time there were about 70,000 lawyers in the United States,
and Lanesborough itself had had in the meantime at least
three distinguished ones. The interests of property and
of reputation, and the constitutional rights of individuals
as over against the claims of Government, so far as these
may be conserved through the agency of lawyers, are by no
means so constant and imperative as are the interests of
life and health. Yet lawyers are in legitimate request in
all civilized countries. A Latin legal maxim announces
the obvious truth: <i>It is the interest of the Commonwealth
that there should be an end of disputes and litigations.</i>
Beyond question courts and counsel are wholesome on the
whole for the individual and for the commonwealth. But
the extremely complicated and unsatisfactory condition of
American Law at present, owing to the fact that we have
a none too simple United States Law with its three grades
of courts and judges, and considerably divergent bodies of
Law in each of 42 States, and owing also to the fact that
our law in general is drawn almost at random from two
pretty distinct Sources, the Common Law of England and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
the Civil Law of Rome, multiplies the number of lawyers
relatively to the population out of all proportion to such
ratio in other countries, and tends to make the lawyers as
a class too conservative of old and drawn-out processes to
the extent of opposing obvious betterments and simplifications.
Said David Dudley Field, President of the American
Bar Association, in August, 1889, at Chicago: "<i>So
far as I am aware, there is no other country calling itself
civilized where it takes so long to punish a criminal, and so
many years to get a final decision between man and man.
Truly we may say, that Justice passes through the land on
leaden sandals. One of our most trustworthy journalists
asserts that more murderers are hung by mobs every year
than are executed in course of law. And yet we have, it is
computed, nearly 70,000 lawyers in the country. The proportion
of the legal element is, in France, 1:4762; in Germany,
1:6423; in the United States, 1:909. Now turn
from the performers to the performance. It appears that
the average length of a lawsuit varies very much in the different
States; the greatest being about 6 years, and the least
1&#189;. Very few States finish a litigation in this shorter period.
Taking all these figures together, is it any wonder that a cynic
should say that we American lawyers talk more and speed
less than any other equal number of men known to history?</i>"</p>

<p>Mr. Field then repeated his well-known argument for
Codification, ascribing the law's delays to the chaotic condition
of the law, and maintaining that it is the first duty
of a government to bring the laws to the knowledge of
the People. "<i>You must, of course, be true to your clients
and the courts, but you must also give speedy justice to your
fellow-citizens, more speedy than you have yet given, and you
must give them a chance to know their laws.</i>"</p>

<p>Owing to the immense difficulties in the way of any
one person mastering the various branches of the law in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
this country, it is falling more and more into specialties,
and lawyers are devoting themselves to some one of its
many branches, the main division line being between
"Law" and "Equity" technically so-called; and whenever
one becomes eminent along any line, his compensation
is apt to be very large owing at once to a large Demand
and to a small Supply at that point, while the average
compensation of the lawyers as a whole class is meagre
enough, because there are too many of them, and the people
have become very suspicious of the law's meshes and
delays.</p>

<p>(c) The grounds for the unabating Demand in Christian
countries for religious teachers and preachers, let us rather
say, for spiritual guides, lie deep down in the nature of
man. If there be one proposition about men more incontestable
than another, it may be this, that men are made in
the image of God, and that there is among men in general
an irrepressible striving to maintain and deepen this image.
The touch between man and man and between man and
God is such at this point, that men can help each other in
this striving, and that they <i>feel</i> that they can help each
other. This is the chief reason why some men are constantly
consecrating themselves to the Christian ministry,
and other men as constantly soliciting these to become
their pastors and teachers. Those more enlightened in
divine things and more spiritually minded offer themselves,
as it were, not commercially but morally, to the unenlightened
and less advanced as guides and helpers. It is, as it
was with Wolfe and his men at the Heights of Abraham:
those who got first to the top tarried a little to help those
up who came after. And the most striking thing about it
is, that the masses of men at bottom are as desirous to be
uplifted as the choicer spirits among them are desirous to
help the work forward. Ministers are still, and always
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
will be (human nature is unchangeable), eagerly called;
chapels and churches and cathedrals are still going up all
over the earth; worship and petition and aspiration are
ever ascending on the great world's altar stairs towards
heaven, guided and inflamed by the chosen and choosing
men of God,&mdash;"<i>when priests on grand cathedral altars
praise</i>!"<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>It is a monstrous perversion of language to maintain,
that a clergyman in rendering such services as these is
selling his religion. It is true, that he is selling under
Demand services to the appropriate rendering of which
his own personal piety contributes one large element, and
thorough confidence in him on the part of his people as a
good and earnest man contributes another large element;
but the piety and the spiritual power and the worthy example
are not nourished for the sake of selling the services,
but for their own sake in personal worth and worthiness,
and these things must not be confounded with the services
that are sold. Accordingly, while the clergyman's vocation
is sacred, and belongs to the sphere of religion, his salary
belongs to the sphere of exchange, and its determination,
in harmony of course with the higher impulses, is a business
transaction. This distinction ought to be better
understood than it is; and both clergymen and people
need to be reminded that the spiritual things belong to
one sphere, and the temporal things to another. The
amount of a minister's salary, and the time and mode of
its payment, are matters of pure business; and the minister
himself is to be blamed if he does not attend to them,
and insist on them, on business principles.</p>

<p>In the professions generally, and particularly in the
ministerial profession, while, if we confine our attention to
those persons who both have the requisite gifts of Nature
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
and have been also thoroughly trained, we shall find a high
rate of compensation on the two grounds of a strong
Demand and a limited Supply, we must bear in mind too
the counter-working influences which tend to increase the
competition and thus decrease the compensation, namely,
the respectability which attends them, the desire of knowledge
for its own sake which is gained in connection with
them, the instruction wholly or in part gratuitously offered
to those in course of preparation for them, and the desire
to do good without regard to pecuniary reward which
actuates many who enter upon them.</p>

<p>(d) Physicians and lawyers and clergymen serve primarily
individuals, or at most relatively small groups of
individuals, and of course look for their pay to those whom
they have served. It is different with Statesmen, the
fourth class of professional laborers that we need to look
at in an economic view. Statesmen worthy of the name
serve at least a whole nation, and to the nation as such
must they turn for their pecuniary rewards. And such
men have never turned in vain to those whom they have
benefited as a whole. Bismarck is the best modern instance
of a Statesman, who has received from a grateful country
immense money-measured remunerations for immense
political services rendered. The Demand for the services
of Statesmen rests in the deep consciousness of men
organized politically into a Nation, that they need, especially
in trying times, a Man of the highest natural gifts,
and of the broadest attainments and of the loftiest political
integrity to plan and act for them in emergencies, as
they are conscious that they cannot plan and act for themselves
organically. This does not mean, that the one
ever knows essentials better than the many: he does not.
This does not mean, that the true objective of a nation's
march is ever discerned more clearly, or rather <i>felt after</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
more eagerly, by one man than by the many men concerned:
it is not. Still less does it mean "<i>a man on horseback</i>."
But it does mean this: a Nation (as the very
name implies) is made up of the thoughts and hopes and
throbbings and dim forecastings and half-formed purposes
of multitudes constituting a unit (born together for one
destiny on earth); and the true Statesman is one of themselves,
sharing with them at once the traditions of the past
and the perspectives of the future; one, with the instinct
and the intellect to gather up and embody the general
feeling and the general will; one, who has gained in some
way the confidence of the masses who are willing for the
time being to entrust to him the guidance of their affairs,
and to empower him to plan and act for them as their
champion and deliverer; and one, who (because he <i>is</i> one)
can better seize the propitious moments for declaration and
negotiation and public action, yet who never forgets that
he is nothing but an <i>agent</i> for others, and is as ready to
lay down responsibility at the public will as to assume it
at the public will.</p>

<p>Washington was such a statesman, and Lincoln. Even
Bismarck, under monarchical and later imperial environment,
disclaims anything substantive and original in his
own action: he did what he could not help doing: he
followed the instincts of Prussia, and his own; and became
the means of fulfilling as they gradually ripened the longings
of the other German people for unity and order.
Such a statesman was Chatham in England, and Cavour
in Italy. Now, such services as these, done for a whole
people, always deserve and usually receive, though not
expressly bargained for beforehand, yet implied in the
public devotion of one party and the general <i>consensus</i> of
the other, extraordinary honors and emoluments. This is
right, even on purely Economic principles. The services
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
of great statesmen to their country in great epochs and
emergencies are at once a gift and a sale, they are both
patriotic and economic, there is equally a national Demand
for them and a grateful recognition of them, the Supply is
always exceedingly rare and the reward often exceedingly
great; and it is to be put down to the lasting credit of
the science of Economics, that its peculiar motives and
results may mingle in and harmonize with the motives and
results of the higher moral impulses, such as those of
Patriotism and Religion, as in the cases of the Soldier and
Statesman and Clergyman. There was no rational ground
for the hesitation of Garibaldi to receive from the Parliament
of Italy in 1875 an annual pension of 50,000 lire.</p>

<p>(e) There is a single class more of Professional laborers,
loosely so-named, which should be noted before we dismiss
the subject of Demand for laborers to pass to consider the
Supply of them, namely, Literators and Artists and Actors
of the highest rank. Statesmen primarily serve the individual
nation that selects and rewards them, though their
influence may indirectly uplift other nations also; but the
great Writers and Painters and Actors, whatever may be
their local habitation and name at first, soon come to
belong to the world at large and to derive their revenue
from many lands, because the highest Art is cosmopolitan
in its own nature, and the best characterization of men as
such cannot but be the property of Mankind. Shakspeare
is no longer English, nor Angelo Italian, nor Mozart
German, nor even Bernhardt French. Deep as are the
scars and the sea that separate nation from nation, there
is something deeper still in the innate recognition by man
of man as depicted by the great Masters in immortal lines.
There is, accordingly, a sort of Demand in the inmost soul
of Humanity as such for these living and lofty touches and
delineations of itself, whencesoever they may come. There
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
is not indeed nor can there be, as in most other cases of
sale, a bargain made beforehand between these preordained
sellers of the rarest services and their silent yet waiting
purchasers, yet there is after all an antecedent and an
assured understanding between them. They are in touch
even across the sea. The master strikes his chord, and
the audience, fit, though few and scattered, listens and
applauds <i>and makes return</i>.</p>

<p>Is the principle of "International Copyright," so-called,
correct? Let us look narrowly before we pronounce. At
present this good country of ours makes itself a mocking
and a by-word even to its own intelligent and art-loving
citizens by putting a tariff-tax of 30% on paintings
and statuary by foreign artists, not at all to get revenue
thereby, but to "protect" domestic artists in their inferior
work by artificially lifting the price of their wares. So far
is carried this jealousy of foreign works of art, that when
the artists generously loan them for exhibition on our
national occasions, they are put under bonds <i>not to sell
them on this side</i> without previously paying the tariff-tax,
which is graciously intermitted during the Exposition.
This is Restriction. This is Protectionism pure and simple.
This is legally excluding the Better in order to give
a forced currency to the Worse. Now, domestic Copyright
restricts the sale of any book to one publisher in his
interest and in that of the author. The book now in the
reader's hand is thus copyrighted. This legal arrangement
between authors and publishers and their public may
be perhaps logically defended, it may even be for the
public weal on the whole, though in many cases it doubtless
raises the price of good books, which would have been
published without any such artificial encouragement. The
copyright, however, like all patent-rights also, soon expires
by limitation of time, and the public thereafter have the
unrestricted use of what is really their own.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<p>For what is sometimes called "literary property" is not
property in the strict sense of the word. A book is not
like a plough or a house. Its contents even when most
original have been but colored, as it were, and rearranged
and reinforced by the author's individual mind. Its substance
always comes out of the common stock. It cannot
be the author's own, as the bushel of wheat is the farmer's,
who sowed the seed on his own land and threshed it in
his own barn and carried it to market in his own wagon.
The rights of the individual and the rights of the Community
commingle more or less in private property of
every kind, at least to the extent that the latter may tax
the property if needful for the common wellbeing, as it is
bound also legally to secure it to the owner when threatened
by others; it is no part of the purpose of the present
book to draw the wavering line in general between the
rights of individuals and the rights of their Government
as towards them; but the distinction between common
property and copyrighted property is plain enough to
everybody, and the Law puts emphasis on the distinction
by making the one quickly terminable and the other continual.
So then, when the Government under which the
author resides, has given him a limited copyright within
its own jurisdiction, it would seem as if the individual
right in the premises had been sufficiently recognized
alongside of the undoubted right of the Whole to the
ultimate use of the labors of their own citizen.</p>

<p>When, however, it comes to International Copyright,
which is an attempt to secure to authors of one country
artificial privileges under restriction in selling their wares
in all other countries, the argument breaks down. Even
for the one country, in which the author lives and is taxable,
the argument is not very strong, and hardly binds
advanced public opinion either as to the grounds of it or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
even the practical benefits of it on the whole. By the
attempted extension of it to all countries, its reasonableness
disappears. Taxation cannot extend beyond the
jurisdiction of the country taxing; and it certainly seems
as if a legal privilege, beyond common law privileges,
ought not by extension through the formal action of other
countries to exempt from taxation (in case it were needful)
the results of the original privilege. The purpose
of International Copyright is not the blessed one as announced
to the world by James Smithson, "<i>the increase
and diffusion of knowledge among mankind</i>," but directly
and artificially by means of legal restrictions the "increase"
of the prices of books and of other "knowledge" to the
masses of "mankind," and the "diffusion" of these extra
prices as between authors and publishers. Protectionism
does not seem to be one whit more respectable in this
form than in the form of tariff-taxes on foreign works of
art.</p>

<p>2. We have already seen in our first chapter the proofs
of the proposition, that the Value of anything whatsoever
bought and sold is determined by the Demand for it and
the Supply of it then and there present. Also we have
now seen at considerable length the main phases and
grounds of the Demand for each of the three classes of
Personal services bought and sold among men. The next
topic in order is the Supply of personal services in the
various markets. Here it will not be necessary to distinguish
particularly the three classes of Services, inasmuch
as the circumstances governing the Supply in each are
substantially similar.</p>

<p>In Economics generally we have to deal chiefly with
Persons, and only subordinately with Things; when we
come to the Supply of personal services, answering to
the Demand for them on the part of other persons, this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
point becomes conspicuous; and it is here, if anywhere,
within the realm of our science, that we need to devote
a word to a singular doctrine, that has been famous
for nearly a century under the term of <i>Malthusianism</i>.
Thomas Robert Malthus, 1766-1836, was an English
clergyman and teacher, a wide traveller and keen observer
of men, one who divided his time during a long life
between cure and chair and the libraries of the Universities,
published in 1798 his "<i>Essay on the Principles of
Population as it affects the Future Improvement of Society</i>";
in this and in subsequent editions enlarged and enriched,
he brought out with its proofs the core of his startling
pronouncement, that the human race is found to increase
in numbers in something like geometrical progression,
while the means of subsistence for them on any given
area of agriculture can only increase in something like
arithmetical proportion; the United States was then doubling
its population in 25 years, and he calculated that, at
this rate, the inhabitants of any country in five centuries
would increase to above a million times their present
number, which would give England in that time more
than twenty million millions of people, or more than
could even get standing-room there; for this natural tendency
of the law of human fecundity to outstrip the results
of the law of returns from land, he saw no remedy except
in checks to population, which he divided into <i>the positive</i>
and <i>the preventive</i>, the first of which, such as war and
famine and disease, increase the annual number of deaths;
and the second of which, such as prudence in contracting
marriage and temperance after marriage, diminish the
number of births; and Malthus and his followers, among
whom the famous Thomas Chalmers was prominent, were
at great pains to inculcate upon the laboring classes the
duty of later marriages and fewer children, as an indispensable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
condition of their rise in comforts, and of "the
future improvement of Society."</p>

<p>These discussions have attracted great attention almost
to the present day, and have been supposed to be very
pertinent to the subject of wages, and thus to be an
important part of Political Economy; but when one looks
more closely, the force of that spring of population which
the Creator has coiled up in the nature of man, as
contrasted with the weakness of that power by which the
earth brings forth sustenance for man, is seen to be a
topic in Physiology and not in Political Economy at all.
Political Economy presupposes the existence of Persons
able and willing to make exchanges with each other, before
it even begins its inquiries and generalizations. How they
come into existence, the rate of their natural increase, and
the ratio of this increase to the increase of food, however
interesting as physiological questions, have clearly nothing
to do with our Science. Each adult human being is as
much constituted by Nature to receive personal services as
to render them, in Economics each without exception
receives when and because he renders, and all alike are
naturally able to become capitalists also; economical laws
present no obstacles, that we can see, to all men becoming
<i>rich</i>, as we use that term; the town or city in which many
people are growing rich simultaneously, is the best place in
the world for other people to go to get rich in, and not at all
towns in which other people are getting poorer; most men
are unwilling, some perhaps may be unable, to fulfil the
moral conditions of growing rich; while, we may depend
upon it, the famines of the world have been caused more
by the indolence and want of foresight of individuals, and
especially by the monstrous maladministrations of Governments,
than by any law of the increase of population.</p>

<p>Experience too has shown, that the strong impulse in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
mankind towards procreation is not too strong for the
purpose intended by the Creator; that <span class="smcap">He</span> who is the
author of the impulses is author also of natural counterworkings
of them; that, as men under moral and religious
training come more and more under the influence of reason
and affection, the preventive checks to population come
silently and effectually into operation; and that, taking
the world at large, food and comforts have more than kept
pace with the stride of population, since its inhabitants as
a whole were plainly never so well fed and clothed and
housed as now. The abstract antagonism of the law of the
increase of population with the law of the increase of food,
or what we prefer to call the law of diminishing returns
from Land, may be admitted, if one chooses to insist on it;
but any practical <i>tendency</i> of these to come into collision,
as the world is and is to be, is confidently denied. When
Malthus wrote, and long afterwards, England was under
the dominance of Protectionism; the wretched Corn-laws
forbidding the importations of foreign grain, in order that
the domestic growers might sell to their countrymen at
artificial prices, and thus grow the richer as bread became the
dearer, were only repealed in 1846; and the demonstrated
ability of Great Britain under free trade to draw on the
fertility of the whole world for the steadily and increasingly
cheap maintenance of her people, demonstrates the irrelevancy
of Malthusianism to the Science of Economics.</p>

<p>The Supply of personal services at any time or place in
answer to the Demand for them, is affected by several
important circumstances, which we shall now proceed to
consider in their order.</p>

<p>(a) The <i>agreeableness</i> or disagreeableness of rendering a
given set of services will affect the Supply of laborers at
that point, and help to determine the rate of Wages paid
to them; because the more agreeable employment will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
attract the larger number of laborers, will experience in
consequence the press of competition, and the rate of wages
then and there will be lessened thereby. The more disagreeable
employment will feel less the pressure of numbers,
and will secure, other things being equal, a higher
rate of remuneration in consequence. Among the elements
which, in spite of diversity of tastes, make any employment
agreeable or disagreeable to the laborers, are (1) the less or
greater exertion of physical strength required, (2) the
healthfulness or unhealthfulness of the service, (3) its
cleanliness or dirtiness, (4) the degree of liberty or confinement
in it, (5) the safety or hazard of the employment,
(6) the esteem or disrepute of it in public opinion. To
illustrate each of these in order, the stone-mason, the glass-blower,
the scavenger, the factory operative, the worker in
a powder-mill, the smuggler, will each receive a larger
compensation owing to the peculiar element of disagreeableness
involved in his own personal service; and he will
be able to demand and secure the higher rate through the
action of this disagreeableness upon the Supply of such
laborers. Of all these elements, public opinion is perhaps
the most operative; and if this be favorable to
an employment, and some social consideration be attached
to it, and only common qualifications be required for
it, the wages in it will infallibly be low. This is doubtless
the main reason why so many young women prefer
to teach, rather than be employed in mills or shops or
offices, and why the wages of female teachers have been
so remarkably low; although each of the elements of agreeableness
specified above may also contribute something
towards the same result. If a business be decidedly opposed
to public opinion, it must hold out the inducement
of a large reward, or nobody will engage in it. This
explains the abnormal gains of the slave-trade, the liquor-business,
of gambling-houses, and of lotteries.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<p>(b) The <i>easiness</i> or difficulty of learning to render
acceptably a given set of personal services, will have a
quick and constant influence on the Supply of these services,
and of course also on the rate of the return paid for
them. The elements of this Difficulty in general are time,
expense, lack of natural gifts, want of foresight on the
part of those concerned, and lack of push and persistency
on the part of the learner himself. To put a boy apprentice
to a trade, for example, requires on the part of the
parents a foresight, an ability to get on without his immediate
help, and sometimes also an amount of money for his
board and clothes which all parents do not possess; many
boys too, who must acquire their skill to sell personal services
when they are young, if at all, find on trial that they do
not like the trade, or have not the requisite gifts, or fail in
the appropriate patience and propulsion; and the consequence
is, that the Supply of laborers along that particular
line is lessened, and the right to demand and the ability to
secure a higher rate of wages than is accorded to common
laborers accompany the small supply, through the reduction
of numbers which these obstacles at the entrance occasion
and the consequent weakness of competition. This is one
principal ground of the difference in the wages of skilled
and unskilled laborers; the other being, as we have seen,
the stronger and more constant Demand for the former,
owing to the impulse imparted by Capital. All these
points of difficulty at the outset apply still more strongly
in the case of professional laborers, serving more effectually
to thin out the ranks of these, and pushing upward still
higher the gauge of compensation for the successful competitors.</p>

<p>(c) The <i>constancy</i> or inconstancy of prospective employment
in a given business, is a consideration that affects
the Supply within it, and then the wages. If the services
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
be of such a character, that they can only be carried on
during nine months of the year, the wages of the renderers
will be greater by the day or the month than they would
be, provided the services were in order during all the
twelve months. The laborer is apt to look at the aggregate
earnings of the year, and will hardly take up a trade
which affords employment but a part of the time, unless
some compensation can be found in the higher wages for
that time. This is the chief reason why the wages of the
mason and house-painter, in this climate at least, are
higher than those of the blacksmith and carpenter. The
coachman, also, may stand by his horses half the day or
night with no call for his services, and must have, therefore,
a proportionably higher fare from those whom he
does transport. In general, it is found that men prefer a
constant rendering with a lower rate of pay, than an inconstant
one with a prospect of larger wages for the particular
jobs actually done; and because the many prefer that,
those who take up with the other are able to secure a
higher relative rate of pay in their less eligible vocation.
It must be noticed, however, as counterworking this, that
some men have desire for intervals of leisure in their business,
and for opportunity to make these intervals subservient
to some avocation or other means of livelihood.</p>

<p>(d) The <i>probability of success</i> or the opposite in any
line of personal services, is a circumstance that has some
influence on the rate of wages paid in it, through the
action of this probability on the numbers of those who
enter upon it. If ultimate success be doubtful, fewer persons
will naturally engage in such a business, and those
who dare in it and succeed, will probably reap a very high
reward. So, also, those who take jobs by the contract, and
therein assume more or less of risk, are commonly paid at a
higher rate for their services than those who do similar
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
work by the day. It is true, that this is owing partly to
the fact that the contractor usually puts in his own capital
more or less, and must therefore be paid profits as well as
wages, and also that the wages of superintendence are due
to him in addition to ordinary wages; still, there is a residuum
of difference, which can only be accounted for by
the risk he runs of a successful issue of his contract. The
general variation in Supply and wages from this fourth
cause, would certainly be greater than it is, were it not for
the overweening confidence which men in all generations
seem to have in their own good luck. This excess of
worldly faith is always seen in the rush which is made for
newly discovered mining regions. It was seen to perfection
in 1889 in the uncontrollable advance of thousands
<i>into</i>, and their almost immediate exit <i>out of</i>, the then just
opened territory of Oklahoma. The facility with which
lottery tickets are sold even yet in many countries proves
the prevalence of this over-confidence. It is demonstrable
beforehand on the doctrine of Chances, that no person can
rationally buy <i>any</i> lottery ticket at its advertised price,
because if that person should buy all the tickets advertised
he would certainly lose money, since the sum of the
prizes is always less than the sum of the prices. Otherwise
the projectors of the lottery would always lose
money.</p>

<p>(e) The <i>mobility</i> or immobility of laborers as a class
acts powerfully upon the Supply of them at any one time
and place, and consequently upon the rates of wages then
and there. In some countries, notably in the United
States, laborers as a class move from place to place with
considerable facility under the action of Demand for personal
services. According to the Census of 1870, 7,500,000
of the native population dwelt in other States than those
in which they were born. Many of these, doubtless, had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
left their native region to obtain more fertile land, and
many also to obtain more remunerative employment as
laborers. The native American, more than most other
persons, is not only willing to move from place to place in
the hope of bettering his condition, but is also willing to
change his occupation from time to time in the same hope.
There is more freedom of movement locally, and less fixedness
of occupation on the part of laborers and others, in
this country than in any other industrial country. Even
foreign immigrants here,&mdash;factory operatives, miners, and
other laborers,&mdash;seem to catch after a while the spirit of
the country in both these respects. There is one considerable
advantage in all this, namely, competition becomes
more uniform in all places, an unusual demand for laborers
at any one point is easily met, and wages neither rise so
high nor fall so low at special points as they otherwise
would. But there are considerable disadvantages in all
this too, chiefly these, the services of laborers floating
locally or changing the kind of their labor can never
become so excellent as service more <i>steady</i> in place and
time; and, especially, thorough apprenticeships, or whatever
may be equivalent to these, are held in too little
esteem by public opinion, and are too little requisite in
order to obtain transient employment. To meet the obvious
pressure of these disadvantages, an admirable device
is now being hit on, namely, to introduce into our public
schools something in the way of "manual training" for
the various trades. Public institutions also, some of them
on a great scale, as the Cooper Union in New York and a
more recent munificent foundation in Philadelphia, have
been established on purpose to train boys and girls both in
eye and hand to render skilfully those artisan services of
the various kinds which will always be in demand among
men, and which have certainly deteriorated among us
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
owing in part to the disuse of the old apprenticeship-system.</p>

<p>In Europe, on the other hand, the laborers as a class are
far less mobile than here; and in Asia still less so. There
is said to be no country in Europe in which the proportion
of foreigners to the native population exceeds <i>three per
centum</i>. In England, which is a small country, the
difference in Wages between the northern and southern
counties is very remarkable. Professor Fawcett is authority
for the statement, that an ordinary agricultural laborer in
Yorkshire during the winter months earns 13 shillings a
week, while a Wiltshire or Dorsetshire laborer doing
similar work during the same number of hours earns but
9 shillings. The contrast in general between the Wages
of English agricultural laborers and those paid in mills
and mines and furnaces is still more striking. And so
more or less, in respect to the Value of Commodities:
competition is yet by no means perfect in distributing
these so as to make their price uniform in the same
country or even in the same county; but the immobility of
laborers for an obvious reason is much greater than the
immobility of goods. While laborers should certainly be
free to go wherever their services may be in greater
Demand, the natural reluctance of most men to leave their
native haunts, enables each of the nations to work out its
freely chosen ends without wholesale interference from
abroad. If China should precipitate itself upon the United
States, or India upon England, as the mere <i>economical</i>
impulse might indicate, it would be disastrous to the
western nations; but men are everywhere under other
influences besides the economical one, although this is
strong and distinct and pervasive; Political Economy deals
with men as they <i>are</i> all things considered, and with
Buying and Selling as this actually takes place over the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
world, or rather as it would take place if factitious
economical restraints were removed; and Providence has
other great ends in view besides commercial prosperity,
vital as that is to all other progress, and often holds one
impulse in check by a stronger one.</p>

<p>(f) <i>Custom</i>, with its cognates Prejudice and Fashion,
has still a good deal to do with the Supply of laborers in
certain departments of effort, and of course with the rates
of wages in them. In former times in this country and
in the older countries particularly, Custom and decree
were dominant in determining, for example, the current
fees of lawyers and doctors, competition coming in to
decide how many such fees a professional laborer should
get, rather than the amount of each particular fee. The
shares of the produce going respectively to the agricultural
tenant and to the landowner, were specially under the
dominion of Custom; as the mode (now decadent) of taking
farms "<i>at the halves</i>," once universally prevalent in New
England, sufficiently shows. In certain other matters relating
to land and trade, Custom has long been gradually hardening
into express law, as, for instance, the famous "Ulster
Right" in Ireland. Prejudice, which is only another name
for Custom, has some voice still in adjusting rates of wages,
as may be seen in women's wages crowded down apparently
to a point unreasonably low as compared with the wages of
men; and also in the rate of John Chinaman's wages in
those parts of the United States where he ventures to offer
his services in the teeth of public opinion and hostile
legislation. It may be spoken with general truth and
satisfaction, that competition seems now to be breaking
down mere custom and prejudice in all directions, and may
perhaps in the good time coming reign supreme over
the economic field; while Fashion, which bears indeed on
one side of its shield the motto "custom," carries too on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
the other the bold word "competition," and this second
side is likely to be presented to the public mostly in the
future, because, they who lead the styles in any department
whatsoever will always offer their services to Society at an
advantage to themselves, that being one form of competition,
and their rate of compensation will be legitimately
higher than the average rate of their fellows, of which a
good instance was the marked worldly prosperity during
the decade of the Eighties of Worth, the man-dressmaker
of Paris.</p>

<p>(g) <i>Legal Restrictions</i> are another cause acting on wages,
by acting directly on the Supply of laborers. Laws inhibiting
or promoting immigration; laws appointing the fees
and salaries of officials; tariff-taxes, whether prohibitory
or only restrictive; laws creating privileged classes of any
kind, which is only another designation for laws restricting
the rights of the masses; unequal modes of taxation,
whether adopted in ignorance or by design; all have a
direct and powerful agency upon the distribution of
laborers, upon the supply of them at given points, and
upon the rates of their wages. Governments are coming,
however, much more freely than formerly, but never
through their natural choice and drift as governments,
only by the gradual and oft-disappointed compulsion of
their citizens, to leave all these matters Economical except
the wages of their own servants and those commodities
which they choose to tax, to the simple and safe action of
Supply and Demand.</p>

<p>(h) <i>Voluntary Associations</i> for that avowed purpose
were a mediæval, and have come to be again a modern,
agency in adjusting the Supply of laborers to their respective
markets, and in regulating the wages of various classes
of them. The Guilds of the Middle Ages, and particularly
the old guilds of London, had a remarkable history, upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
which we can not here even touch. Their local importance
is sufficiently attested by the fact, that the City Hall of
London is to this day the "Guildhall." King Edward III.
humored the civic feeling of his time by becoming himself
a member of the Guild of Armorers. "A seven years'
apprenticeship formed the necessary prelude to full membership
of any trade-guild. Their regulations were of
the minutest character; the quality and value of work
was rigidly prescribed, the hours of toil fixed from daybreak
to curfew, and strict provision made against competition
in labor. At each meeting of these guilds their
members gathered round the Craft-box, which contained
the rules of their Society, and stood with bared heads as it
was opened. The warden and a quorum of guild-brothers
formed a court which enforced the ordinances of the guild,
inspected all work done by its members, confiscated unlawful
tools or unworthy goods; and disobedience to their
orders was punished by fines, or in the last resort by
expulsion, which involved the loss of right to trade. A
common fund was raised by contributions among the
members, which not only provided for the trade objects of
the guild, but sufficed to found chantries and masses, and
set up painted windows in the church of their patron saint.
Even at the present day the arms of the craft-guild may
often be seen blazoned in cathedrals, side by side with
those of prelates and kings."<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>The Trades-Unions and Brotherhoods of the present
day cannot plead the provocations and justifications of
their mediæval predecessors. It cannot be denied, however,
that they have some provocations and justifications
in the bad example set before them by the various combinations
(implied or explicit) of the Wages-payers as a
class. If the Wages-payers combine, then the Wages-takers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
would seem to have no resource but in combination.
Both alike are wrong in this. Both alike oppose in this
the spirit of Political Economy, which is ever the spirit of
Freedom, and is ever against such factitious associations
for such purposes, because they tend to destroy the independence
of personal action on the part of both payers and
takers of wages, and tend also to bring all the workmen
of any one general grade down to one level of effort and
reward.</p>

<p>(i) Lastly, we must note the influence of <i>Casual Events</i>
upon wages, as these events affect the Supply of laborers.
For example, in 1348, a terrible plague, called the Black
Death, invaded England and swept away more than one-half
of its population. "Even when the first burst of panic
was over, the sudden rise of wages consequent on the
enormous diminution in the supply of free labor, though
accompanied by a corresponding rise in the price of food,
rudely disturbed the course of industrial employments;
harvests rotted on the ground, and fields were left untilled,
not merely from scarcity of hands, but from the strife
which now for the first time revealed itself between Capital
and Labor" (Green). The landowners of the country
districts, and the craftsmen of the towns, not understanding
the law of Wages as an invariable resultant of the
Demand and Supply of laborers, were scandalized by what
seemed to them the extravagant demands of the new
labor-class. Parliament equally ignorant with the People
of the natural economic law, enacted as follows: "<i>Every
man or woman of whatsoever condition, free or bond, able
in body, and within the age of threescore years, and not having
of his own whereof he may live, nor land of his own
about the tillage of which he may occupy himself, and not
serving any other, shall be bound to serve the employer who
shall require him to do so, and shall take only the wages</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
<i>which were accustomed to be taken in the neighborhood where
he is bound to serve two years before the plague began.</i>"
Afterwards, the runaway laborer was ordered by Parliamentary
enactment to be branded in the forehead by a
hot iron, and the harboring of the country serfs in the
towns, in which under their civic rules a serf keeping himself
a year and a day was thereafter free, was rigorously
forbidden. These acts of Parliament, and many more of
the same kind, were powerless to keep down wages to the
old standard, but were powerful to keep up ill-blood and
social discontent. They prepared the way for agitators
like John Ball, for the poet-agitator Piers Ploughman, and
for the great Peasant Revolt of 1381. John Ball's famous
rhyme condensed the scorn for the nobles, the longing for
just rule, and the resentment at oppression, of the peasants
of that time and of all times:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"When Adam delved and Eve span,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who was then the gentleman?"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>A hundred years after the Black Death the wages of a
common English laborer&mdash;we have the highest authority
for the statement&mdash;commanded twice the amount of the
necessaries of life which could have been obtained for the
wages paid under Edward III.</p>

<p>3. Having now seen fully the varied action of Supply
and Demand upon the Value of personal services in their
three kinds, we come at length to the most important
general point in this chapter, namely, that in the second
class of Services, those purchased in connection with the
use of <i>Capital</i>, <span class="smcap">Wages are all the time enlarging
relatively to Profits</span>. We have seen clearly already,
that Cost of Labor and Cost of Capital are the only onerous
elements in the cost of Commodities; because, while
Natural Agents are all the time assisting and assisting more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
and more effectively in such production, they work without
weariness or decay and without fee or reward. The
reward of laborers is Wages, and the reward of capitalists
is Profits; and we are now to demonstrate, that the part of
their joint products falling to laborers as wages is all the
while increasing as compared with the remaining part falling
to capitalists as profits. This truth is of the deepest
significance, and of the most cheering character; because
men are more important in the universe than things; and
because the number of men who sell their services as laborers
is vastly greater than the number of men who sell their
services as capitalists.</p>

<p>It is another indisputable and exhilarating truth for the
masses of mankind, that the Value of each item or article
of those products created by the joint action of laborers
and capitalists is ever becoming less and less as measured
by any relatively fixed standard as Money; so that, while
wages as thus measured becomes a larger and larger aggregate
as compared with the aggregate of profits, and is
shared of course by a much larger number of people,
those commodities looked at as a collection of items for
which the wages of these many is usually expended for
their own comforts, are becoming all the time cheaper
and cheaper to everybody, owing to the ever-enlarging
and wholly gratuitous action of natural forces.</p>

<p>For the sake of simplicity in the argument on this great
point, we will first look at what the facts are through
recent illustrations gathered by other parties for a wholly
different purpose, and then give in detail the economical
grounds for these patent and universal facts. Take for
example, from Poor's Railroad Manual for 1889 a table
showing in a graphic way the steady reduction in freight
charges per ton per mile from 1865 to 1888 of seven representative
Eastern trunk railroad lines, namely, the Pennsylvania,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
Fort Wayne and Chicago, New York Central,
Michigan Central, Lake Shore, Boston and Albany, and
Lake Erie and Western; and of six leading Western roads,
namely, the Illinois Central, St. Paul, Burlington and
Quincy, Chicago and Northwestern, Rock Island, and
Chicago and Alton. The following are the figures:&mdash;</p>

<p>This reduction of rates in the case of the group of
Eastern roads has amounted to 79 <i>per centum</i>, and in the
Western group to 73 <i>per centum</i>, in the twenty-four years.
Not less remarkable than the extent of this decline in
freight charges per mile is its uniformity. Both groups
show a wonderful steadiness in the progress of rate reductions.
Starting at quite different points as to territorial
development, they have yet travelled at a nearly equal pace
in the same direction. This shows the operation of causes
at once steady and universal. Statistics can never of themselves
yield us <i>causes</i>; but they guide the way to them;
at any rate, they prevent any radical misinterpretation of
them. The great and overshadowing cause here of the
cheaper freights per ton, as everywhere else of cheaper
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
rates at the junction of efforts by capitalists and laborers,
is of course the perpetual and augmenting and ever-gratuitous
assistance of natural forces at every point.</p>

<p>While the rates of freight per ton have decreased more
than three-quarters in less than one-quarter of a century
in the case of these 13 railroads on the whole average, the
entire cost of the operation of these roads in this interval
of time has not been diminished to any appreciable extent,
as also stated by the same Manual. The main item in all
the operation-expenses of railroads is the wages paid to
the laborers of all grades; and the laborers are quite as
well paid now on these 13 roads as they were in 1865,
proper allowances being made for the changed and changing
standards in the national Money. If, on a broad view,
railroad employees of all grades have lost nothing as such
in their wages in this interval; and the general public,
including these laborers and also the capitalists concerned,
have greatly gained, how can we account for the immensely
lessened freight-charges while the whole operation-expenses
continue substantially as before?</p>

<p>There is only one rational account to be given of this.
And it is trustworthy. All known facts jump with it, and
nothing substantial can be urged against it. The gains to
the masses including the capitalists and the laborers <i>have
come out of the capitalists as such</i>. This is apparent as well
as real. Cost of Labor and Cost of Capital is the whole
cost. If the whole cost of moving one ton of freight from
Boston to Chicago is &#190; less than it was &#188; of a century ago,
the cost of the labor being the same at the two points of
time, then the conclusion is inevitable, that the <i>cost of the
capital</i> at the second point is less than it was at the first
point. With this conclusion all facts agree. All the
laborers connected with a railroad from highest to lowest
must be paid at any rate, or else the trains will certainly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
cease to move, whether the stockholders receive any
dividend or not on their capital invested. The original
<i>stock</i>&mdash;the capital that built the roads&mdash;of many if not of
most the railroads in the country, has been annihilated, a
new indebtedness in another form called <i>bonds</i> having
taken the place of it. Even the nominal dividends of
dividend-paying roads have declined in the interval from
10 or 8 to 5 or 4 <i>per centum</i> in the general, that is, 50 <i>per
centum</i>. It is perfectly evident on every hand, that there
is something in the nature and progress of things, that
makes for wages as contrasted with profits: wages hold on
and relatively enlarge, profits decline or go out altogether.</p>

<p>Fortunately we are not left to generalities here, however
plain and certain these may be. One of the 13 railroads
specified above, the Illinois Central, made a remarkable
exhibit in its own annual Report of 1887, showing the cost
of its locomotive service for each year of the thirty years
preceding. This cost per mile run had fallen from 26.52
cents in 1857 to 13.93 cents in 1886. This reduction had
been effected wholly on the <i>Capital</i> side of the account, by
inventions and improvements of all sorts in the <i>machinery</i>
of locomotion; while the wages of the engineers and
firemen had risen in the period from 4.51 cents to 5.52 cents
per mile run. The cost of the labor had risen both
relatively and absolutely while the cost of the capital had
declined both absolutely and relatively. In 1857 the
engineers and firemen had received as wages 17% of the
entire cost of the locomotive service, but in 1886 they had
received 39% of that total cost. The table is as follows:

<p>These illustrations from the railroads are plainly indicative
of a general truth of the utmost importance in
Political Economy, namely, <i>that all increase of Capital and
all inventions and improvements in its practical application,
while it redounds to the benefit of capitalists as a class,
redounds in a still higher degree to the benefit of laborers as
a class</i>. Let us now attend for a moment to the convincing
Proof of this truth in two phases of such proof, and also
to a cheering conclusion that follows it.</p>

<p>(a) As any country grows older in time and richer
through abstinence, and as the whole world thus grows
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
older and richer, the tendency there and everywhere
towards a general decline in the rate <i>per centum</i> for the
use of capital becomes patent and universal. The rate of
interest on money loaned, and the rate of profits on capital
used, tend all the while to go down as and because capital
accumulates. No one will dispute this as a simple fact of
history. And no economist will dispute, that this is just
what we might expect beforehand as a corollary from the
admitted proposition, that, other things being equal, an
increased Supply of anything means a lessened Value for
any specific part of it. Three centuries ago in England
the legal rate of interest was 10%, while now the current
rate is about 4% in that country, and has been considerably
lower than that in Holland, although in both countries
and everywhere else there are temporary interruptions and
reactions in the constant tendency now being considered.
During the first years of mining operations in California,
from 8% to 15% per month with security of real estate
was paid for the use of money, which enormous rates long
ago declined to rates not much higher than those paid in
the States along the Mississippi River, and in these also
the rates are all the while approximating those current in
the older Eastern States, whose own rates too are slowly
declining. But, while there is a less rate of profit or
interest on each 100 invested, there are many more hundreds
capitalized; consequently, there is an absolute gain
to capitalists as a class, at once in the aggregate amount
of the capital and in the aggregate sum of the profits from
it, since no capitalist would have a motive to capitalize
further under the smaller rates of profit, unless the aggregate
of profits under the new conditions were greater than
under the old condition of higher rates; and, as much of
this accumulating capital in order to become productive
must now be offered to laborers in the form of wages, we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
might almost pronounce beforehand, that it would prove
both an absolute and also a <i>relative</i> gain to laborers as a
class. And so it is.</p>

<p>(b) Let us take to figures. An hypothesis or supposed
case, whenever it may easily become an overt fact, may be
reasoned from just as logically and securely as the overt
fact itself. Let $100,000,000, while the rate of profit is
6%, and $500,000,000, when the rate has fallen to 4%, be
expended in payment of simple wages. So far forth as
that one element of cost goes, the value of the products
to be divided yearly between capitalists and laborers will
become respectively $106,000,000 and $520,000,000. In the
first case, $6,000,000 is profits and $100,000,000 is wages;
in the second case, $20,000,000 is profits and $500,000,000
is wages. Here is an absolute gain to the capitalists, since
profits have gone up from $6,000,000 to $20,000,000, and
so are more than <i>three</i> times as great as before. But
wages have gone up both absolutely and relatively to the
rise of profits. They have risen from $100,000,000 to
$500,000,000, and are <i>five</i> times as great as before. Profits
have risen as in the ratio 1:3<big>+</big>, but wages in the ratio of
1:5. This arithmetical example is put for the sake of
illustration merely, but the principle of it holds good in
every case, in which the rate <i>per centum</i> goes down in
consequence of the increase of capital in business; and,
therefore, the advantages of ever-enlarging Capital are
even greater to laborers as a class than to the capitalists
themselves. Most assuredly, if the capitalists take less out
of each hundred of the swelling hundreds now than before,
the laborers must take more out of each hundred than
before. Profits and Wages are reciprocally the <i>leavings</i>
of each other, because the aggregate products created by
the joint agency of Capitalist and Laborer are wholly to
be divided between the two. There can be no other
<i>claimant</i> even.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>

<p>(c) This demonstration is extremely important in Political
Economy, and consequently in Social Life; for it
proves beyond the possibility of a cavil, the Value of personal
services tends constantly to rise, not only as compared
with the Value of the material commodities which
by the aid of capital they help to create (a truth we have
seen before), but also as compared with the Value of the
use of its co-partner capital itself; and therefore, that
there is inwrought into the very substance of things in
this world a tendency towards an equality of economical
condition among men. God has ordered it, and men cannot
radically alter it. Self-interest is indeed the mainspring
of movement in the economic world; but the
beauty of it and the wonder of it is, that no man can labor
intelligently and productively under the influence of self-interest
without at the same time benefiting the masses of
men. His fair exchanges benefit the parties of the other
part as much as they benefit himself. His very savings
productively employed are poor men's livings. Only under
the blessed freedom of universal Buying and Selling,
subject only to the taxation of a good Government for
public purposes purely, can these broad benefits designed
by a wise Providence be fully realized in action; and the
power of individual greed and corporate privilege and
governmental perversion to thwart the beneficent though
complicated workings of these laws of Capital and Labor
towards the common weal and universal progress of mankind
is shortlived and soon punished.</p>

<p>4. How comes it about, then, if these laws of mutual
inter-dependence between capitalists and laborers are so
well-placed and Providentially balanced, that there always
have been and are still so many misunderstandings and ill-feelings
and actual collisions between employers and skilled
laborers, whose interests are at bottom one and whose
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
relations ought to be so cordial? This is the last topic
in our Chapter on Personal Services. Here we must look
around narrowly and tread carefully. But there is a
path. We can find it if we will. It leads through many
short-comings in men's characters and through much ignorance
of plain economical truths and past unreasoning jealousies
and aggregated action on the part of both classes, and
over the needful distinctions between impulsive selfishness
and a true self-interest back to the same old laws of God
laid down at once in the constitution of things and in the
constitution of men.</p>

<p>Labor-troubles are almost as old as Civilization. The
Greek poet Euripides in his play of the "Supplicants"
both indicates facts as they were then, and points out a
future hope in which we may share, that these middle
classes by a better harmony preordained and mutually
beneficial may yet "save the State":&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i26">"In each State<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are marked three classes: of the public good<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The rich are listless, all their thoughts to more<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Guardians of order, and their country's laws."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>At Rome and in the Roman Empire, instead of the usual
voluntary union of capitalists and laborers for the mutual
advantage of each other, the laborer was owned by the
capitalist, and the true relations between the two were
thoroughly disguised and wretchedly distorted. Business
in all its branches came to be carried on by means of slaves;
the lands were tilled by slaves; slaves became the artisans
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
of the country; the money-lenders and bankers of the
centre scattered branch-banks in the towns under the
direction of their slaves and freedmen; the Company that
leased on speculation the Customs-Taxes from the State
had their slaves and freedmen levy these taxes at each
custom-house; the contractor for buildings bought architect-slaves;
and the merchant imported his goods in ships of
his own manned by his slaves or freedmen, and then sold
the same at wholesale or retail by the same means. In this
way a gigantic system of unnatural traffic was built up and
extended. In this way the very name "laborer" became
tainted by the vile system of slavery of which he was
a part, and the distinction itself between capitalist and
laborer was obliterated. "Roman mercantile transactions
fully kept pace with the contemporary development of political
power, and were no less grand of their kind." "The
Roman <i>denarius</i> followed up closely the Roman legions."
"It is very possible that, compared with the suffering
of the Roman slaves, the sum of all negro suffering is
but a drop" (Mommsen).</p>

<p>We want now to examine critically the <span class="smcap">causes</span> of these
constantly recurring labor-troubles, the true economical
<span class="smcap">Remedies</span> for them, and in connection with these the
futility of the remedies popularly recommended for low
Wages and the disputes between employers and employed
of the second class.</p>

<p>(1) There is an extremely common misapprehension on
the part of both labor-givers and labor-takers as to the real
<i>nature</i> of the transaction between them. Both parties
forget, or rather neither party is ever fully instructed, that
it is a case of pure Buying and Selling. There is never any
<i>obligation</i> of the moral sort between buyers and sellers.
The relation itself is purely economical. Moral considerations
indeed cover this relation from above, just as they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
cover all other relations between man and man in human
Society; and any two individuals standing over against
one another as buyer and seller, also stand over against
each other in higher and broader relations as man and man;
but it works confusion and mischief as between both,
whenever relations differing in their nature and operation
and reward are not separated from each other in the mind
of each relator, and whenever each does not act in the
particular relation according to the nature and rules of
that relation alone. When A hires B to work in his factory,
this new relation is economical not moral; there were
moral relations between the two before this relation was
knit, and will be again after this has been broken, and
indeed are while this continues; but the economical relation
is one thing, and the others a very different thing; they
are so different, that they cannot be blended in mind or
motive to any advantage to either individual or to either
set of relations; and any degree of confusion as between
the relations has always wrought mischief as between the
individuals, because instead of seeing either set of relations
in its own clear light, they now see both in a commingled
twilight.</p>

<p>What is the economical relation? This. A desires the
personal service of B in his factory purely for his pecuniary
benefit, and assumes his own ability to make all the
calculations requisite for determining how much he can
(profitably to himself) offer B for his service; and B, who
knows all about his own skill, how it was acquired and
how much it has cost, wants to sell his service to A for
the sake of the pecuniary return or wages. There is no
obligation resting upon either. Man to man, each in his
own right. There is no benevolence in the heart of either,
so far as this matter goes. Benevolence is now an impertinence.
It is a question of honest gain in broad daylight.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
Benevolence is blessed in its own sphere, but there is no
call for it here and now. If it comes in an unbidden guest,
it comes in to mar and to distort. It is an incongruity. "<i>I
never knew a Jew converted but it spoilt him</i>," was the word
of one deeply versed in human nature and in Christian
experience. Conversion is good, and its field is broad;
but the Jew <i>as such</i> is incongruous with it. Good is
benevolence and wide its field, but Buying and Selling
does not need it. Its own motives are independent of it,
and sufficient without it.</p>

<p>A clouded understanding of this vital distinction has
always played its part in Labor-troubles. Buyers and
Sellers of personal services are always on a plane of perfect
equality as such exchangers, and no one can be more independent
than either of them except the hermit in his cell.
Which must look out for the interest of the other beyond
the terms implied in the trade itself? Which is the superior
party? Which should take off his hat, the other
remaining covered? The truth is, and all experience and
all analysis brings us up abreast of it, that the two parties
to a trade of any kind stand on a footing of absolute
equality towards each other then and there in the economical
relation about to be knit, and any conception in the
mind of either that he has the other "at his mercy" in
either the good or bad sense of that phrase, disturbs and
destroys the proper conditions and balances of the exchange
in hand; and, what is more to the point, it implies that
each party has <i>not</i> all he can do to fulfil in the letter and
in the spirit what is always implied in the terms of a trade
deliberately entered upon by two parties. When B agrees
to work for A at skilled labor in his factory for a year at
$15 per week, he makes a good deal of a contract; and
virtually pledges to A not only the motions of his hands
for that period of time, but also the vigorous attention of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
his mind to that service and to the general interests of his
employer so far as these come under his own eye and
supervision. Nor is this all: he virtually pledges himself
to B to coöperate with the least possible friction in all
plans for betterment in his division of the work, and to
cordially coalesce with all other employees for the general
ends of the business without too much of self-assertion and
without too little of courtesy to others. To fulfil this contract
in all its spirit rounds up the circle of B's economical
obligations to A. He will practically have all he can do, so
far as A is concerned, and in consistency with all his various
duties to others, to make good to him at all points his
simple business pledges. Benevolence, the interests of a
common citizenship, and the reciprocal ties of religion, lie
wholly outside.</p>

<p>A will practically have all he can do, so far as B is
concerned, to fulfil in the letter and in the spirit his
economical obligations to him, without troubling himself
to see whether B is going to vote the same party ticket
that he himself votes, and without confounding either B's
poverty or prosperity with his own obligation to be polite
to him at all times and to pay him promptly his weekly
stipend. So long as B renders in letter and in spirit what
he has agreed to render, and A returns in the same way
what he has promised to return, the less either thinks and
talks and acts about the other in all the other relations of
life, the better hope of good success to both in this relation.
Church relations and social relations and political relations
are all of consequence in themselves; but when any of
these begin to get mixed up with labor-relations, there is
soon a muss and a mess. Incongruous things, things
no way vitally connected with that, often come in to disturb
and destroy a simple matter of mutual renderings.</p>

<p>(a) The first practical remedy for difficulties arising
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
under this first head, is a clearer separation in the mind
of both parties to a trade of what really belongs to Buying
and Selling from what belongs to all other departments of
activity. More common sense is needed at this point,
more simple analysis, more daylight, more personal independence,
more introspection as to motives, more power in
making distinctions, and a more practical separation of
what is clear and fixed from what is complex and obscure
in human relations. Metaphysics may yet lie in cloud-land,
Ethics may not yet have drawn its outer and interior
lines so strong and deep as it will, Sociology also is a
vast field of complexities, but truth to tell Economics has
no mysteries to speak of. I buy and sell for my own
advantage, which proves in the nature of things to be for
the equal advantage of my compeer. It is my business
and my compeer's business and every other man's business
who buys and sells, to pick that action out in its motive
and result from the great mass of dubious actions, and to
set it up in its own light, to rejoice in it as the clearest
thing in social action, to claim it as God's own plan so far
forth for our comfort and progress, and then to see to
it that no preposterous hand mixes it up with perplexities
or theologies or other abominations&mdash;muddying with a
tentative pole the stream of our clear brook! In this
country at least, in its ignorance of common things and
common science, the pulpit often fulminates against the
gains of exchange as "materialism," and mixes up buying
and selling with "worldliness," and only half permits its
deluded hearers the privileges of the market, and illustrates
again in modern times such teaching as is denounced to
St. Timothy,&mdash;"<i>some swerving turned aside to vain babbling,
desiring to be teachers of the Law, understanding
neither what they say, nor whereof they affirm</i>." "Let every
shoemaker stick to his last." Those who have looked into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
it with any care have found, that Exchange in all its natural
outgoings is not answerable to these pulpit charges, nor
is contrary to the letter or spirit of the biblical precepts,
but on the other hand is in full harmony with the claims
of Conscience and with all the inbreathings and aspirations
of Christianity.</p>

<p>(b) The second practical remedy for the labor-difficulties
arising from the want of thorough understanding by
both parties of the real nature of hired renderings of the
second class, is fair <i>common honesty</i>. More of an easily
accessible intelligence, more of penetration and separation
as to social relations in general, meets the first point; but
quite as needful as this simple intellectual process, is the
still simpler moral habit of doing just what one has agreed
to do, without evasions and without diminutions. Labor
difficulties take their origin more often, perhaps, in some
clouded moral action of one of the parties, than in a
clouded mental apprehension. Men are too conscious as
men of their own temptations, to be lax in their pledged
renderings and of their own shortcomings at this point,
not to be suspicious of each other as buyers and sellers,
for fear the party of the other part is about to withdraw
something either in quantity or quality of what he has
promised to render; there is almost always something or
other to give color to such a suspicion, and it grows by
what it feeds on; frank explanations are not had at the
outset, and a good understanding is not come to, as it
doubtless might be in nine cases out of ten; and the little
cloud, at first no bigger than a man's hand, by and by
becomes black and threatening, and bursts at last in a
strike or lock-out of large proportions. An open honesty
that is such and seems such, that is not beyond the aim and
reach of common men, that is taught in scores of forms in
"Poor Richard's Almanack," and that each man ever likes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
to meet with and so ought ever to put forth, is in fact a preventive
of conflicts between laborers and employers, and
would if properly manifested have prevented multitudes
of such actual conflicts. Here is the main, almost the sole,
point of contact between strict Ethics and the Economics.
What buyers and sellers, that is to say, the whole practical
world, needs, is not disquisitions on Morals from Press
or Pulpit, but an inner ear to hear the true click of
Conscience, and the quick and open answer in honest
action.</p>

<p>(2) A second general cause of the Labor-troubles of the
past and present has been a strong tendency to neglect the
special <i>preparation</i> for their peculiar functions by both
capitalists and laborers. A successful employer of laborers
year in and year out to their advantage and his own is
always one who has been <i>trained</i> to that function by
special preparations. He is a living man with all the limitations
of living men: he has to deal with many living
men with all their imperfections: he has to deal also, and
constantly, with what is in its own nature dead, namely,
Capital, always either a commodity or a claim: to animate
and invigorate these dead forms of value, to put them into
vital connection with living men who shall enhance their
value, and thus to become a leader to living men as
towards swelling interests, demands unusual native gifts
and a special long-continued training. When one looks
from without upon such an establishment as this in full
action, it seems automatic, it seems as if almost anybody
with a clear head could continue to direct it; and when
this "captain of industry" departs this life, perhaps his
son or some previous subordinate, without the proper gifts
and at least without the peculiar training, assumes the
post of direction. For a little everything seems to go on
as before. As sure as fate, however, a friction will soon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
develop here, and a misunderstanding there, there will be
whisperings among the men, some breath of suspicion
will be likely to cloud the borrowing-power, opening
difficulties of any kind such as loss of credit or a weakening
of the usual markets are apt to throw a new operator
more or less off his base, and gathering labor-troubles of
any sort commonly find such a man unprepared for lack
of suitable training and experience to ward them off or to
make timely concessions to the men or to minimize the
evil results when these become inevitable.</p>

<p>Also labor-troubles are quite as likely to arise from the
want of character and training and considerateness of the
employees towards the capitalists. The relations are
reciprocal and they are also in their very nature delicate.
One poor workman however good his disposition, one
unfaithful overseer no matter how great his possible skill,
may mar the current product in such a way as to lose it
the market and cost the establishment the present profit.
The strength of a chain is the strength of its weakest link.
It is a matter of immense difficulty at any time, and
emphatically so at the present time to organize a working
force in factory from top to bottom so as to have it go
forward as a unit as towards the marketing of the product,
without bad workmanship at some point and unskilful
supervision at another; because the laborers as a rule have
not given themselves time to learn thoroughly their special
parts, because they are not content to remain steady at one
thing and at one place, and because they do not practically
recognize even if they perceive it that their own permanent
interests are exactly coincident with the permanent interests
of their employers. Just now in this country the
public Law robs the manufacturers (at their own behest)
of their best markets at home and abroad, makes it difficult
or impossible for them through wanton taxation of their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
raw materials to create a good quality of goods for any
market, and so multiplies frictions and failures and losses
along the whole line of production. The lack of what
may be called Apprenticeship on the part of skilled laborers,
the consequent difficulty of rising from one gradation of
effort to a higher and better-paid one, the restlessness of
native laborers under such disabilities, the rapid admixture
of foreigners, the lack of coherence throughout in point of
intelligence and apparent identity of interests, together
with the instability and haphazardness of the resources and
personal training of the employers as a class, gives birth to
Labor-troubles which are at the same time Capital-troubles,
to read the daily record of which makes one sick at heart.</p>

<p>(a) The only possible and practicable remedy for this
state of things, so far as the employers are concerned, is in a
more conservative attitude of capitalists as a class about
passing over their resources to the hands of men who have
not proven their ability to handle them wisely by a full
course of training in the management of practical affairs.
By a wretched policy in this country at present Capital is
prohibited from building and from buying ships, with which
to navigate the oceans; from selling domestic manufactures
in foreign markets; and also from a profitable agriculture,
which may sell its products abroad and take its
pay back. Consequently Capital, eager in its own nature
to be invested to a profit somehow somewhere, has rushed
without due circumspection into the hands of domestic
operators, who have not been half fitted for their task,
who have knitted relations with laborers without being
able to secure their permanent respect or to control their
services, and who have lost to their owners in multitudes
of cases the entire capital intrusted to them. If capitalists
had had during the last quarter of a century one-half of
their natural and proper chance to invest their money to a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
profit, there would not have been such a reckless investment
through incompetent hands in building mills and
foundries in this interval of time, and such wholesale
losses in connection with them. When capital comes to
be at liberty to turn right or left according to its own will
in view of a prospective profit, factory companies and projectors
cannot draw resources from the public for their
operations, without demonstrating to the owners the trained
and tried capacity of the practical operators, who will buy
the materials and hire the laborers and market the products.</p>

<p>(b) The practical remedy for the inexperience and instability
and unskilfulness of laborers as tending towards
labor-troubles of all kinds and degrees, is only to be found
in a want of market for such services. In a natural and
wholesome state of things, such as would exist in the
United States were it not for national laws tampering
with Trade and with Money, the questions asked an
applicant for skilled work by any labor-taker would be,
"<i>What have you learned to do? How long and for what
pay do you want to do it? What do you want to reach next,
when the present job is done?</i>" When employment turns
on good answers to such questions as these, and when the
questions themselves are put in good faith, there will be
an end of Strikes and Lockouts. Untrained and restless
hands will get nothing to do in mills and factories.
Apprenticeship in its various forms will come back into
vogue, and will probably be made a part of the course in
public schools. The division and gradation of laborers
will be carried out further than it ever yet has been.
Laborers will then be <i>organized</i> in the best sense of that
word, and to the best advantage of capitalists. The permanent
Supply of skilled laborers will be constantly
adjusting itself to a permanent and increasing Demand for
them. And it requires no millennium for such a state of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
things to come in. It requires nothing but an ordinary
and enlightened and beneficent selfishness on the part of
capitalists to adjust itself to the ordinary selfishness of
laborers sure to become enlightened and beneficent to the
best and ever-growing interests of both parties. This is
not the spoken word of Morality, still less is it the divine
word of Religion, it is only the common programme of a
common-sense Political Economy.</p>

<p>(3) The third and last general cause of misunderstandings
and embittered disputes as between laborers and
capitalists is partly economical and partly moral, and consequently
the remedy for it is partly moral and partly
economical. The Past projects itself down into the Present
partly with blessings and partly with curses. In the old
times under Slavery and Feudalism the laborer always
came forward to his task with a taint upon him. Sometimes
the taint attached to his birth, and at all times it
attached to his calling. Slavery in all its forms always
makes manual labor degrading. The courtly Cicero <i>apologizes</i>
in a letter to his friend for his open sorrow over the
death of his favorite slave; and in several passages of his
treatise on Morals he follows his Greek teachers, Plato and
Aristotle, and declaims in a pitiful way against the noble
rights of laborers. "<i>All artisans are engaged in a degrading
profession.</i>" Again, "<i>there can be nothing ingenuous in a
workshop</i>." When trade and commerce are carried on
on a small scale, "<i>they are to be regarded as disgraceful</i>";
when on a large scale, "<i>they must not be greatly condemned&mdash;non
admodum vituperanda</i>!" (I, 42.)</p>

<p>Serfdom once existed in England, and threw its shade
over free laborers there long after itself had disappeared.
A class of indented servants pervaded all the New England
Colonies, and a clause of the New England Confederation
of 1643 provided for their forced rendition from Colony to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
Colony, and passed over almost verbally into the Constitution
of the United States of 1787 as applicable to the
slaves of the South. In this way in all parts of this
country manual laborers came to be more or less off color,
and this has continued in a continually lessened degree till
this time. When those who work with their hands are
looked down upon by those who do not, two sets of feelings
are apt to be engendered equally unfortunate to the two
classes that entertain them. The non-manual workers, the
employers, are more or less puffed up with pride and a
sense of superiority (there are beautiful exceptions) as
towards their laborers, and the latter in their turn are apt
to develop alongside an unmanly servility and an apparent
deference, a sort of secret breasting up of hostility and
defiance, which is sure to manifest itself when labor
troubles come on even when it has not helped to brood
these troubles into life. The parties then are not well
placed as towards each other to negotiate and to compromise
and to coalesce in a future harmony. The party
of the first part is too proud to yield to their inferiors, and
the party of the second part is too bitter to be sweetened.
Who is sufficient for these things? And what is the remedy
for them?</p>

<p>(a) So far as employers are concerned, their natural
though unreasonable and provoking arrogance may well be
reduced by the economical reflection, that the laborers are
exactly as necessary to production as the capitalists are,
that the two stand on a precise level so far as the product
goes, that each is one blade of the shears and the other the
other and that it takes both blades to cut anything, that
while the laborers are sellers in the open market the
capitalists are likewise sellers and that the same ultimate
purchaser furnishes the market for both sets of sellers, that
as sellers they are only equal in position, that buying and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
selling is a levelling as well as an uplifting process the
world over, and that as such co-equal partners in one
indivisible operation all haughtiness on one side and all
undue humility on the other is nothing but obstacle as
towards the common end; and also by the moral and social
reflection, that their laborers are just such men as themselves
in motive and action, that the two are very likely to
exchange places with each other before very long, that
riches are extremely liable to take to themselves wings
and fly away, that Christianity is no respecter of persons,
that humanity deems nothing human alien from itself, that
morality puts the golden rule upon the fore-front of its
precepts, and that whatever may unite any body of men
in a legitimate purpose of achievement along any line of
human action multiplies the power of each individual and
exalts his standing and responsibility as such individual
and thus reduplicates the reward of his individual action.</p>

<p>(b) So far as the employees are concerned, in any temporary
sense of dependence or even of injustice, there is
open to them the economical reflection (and it will do
them good to bring it home) that their best route to
the respect and favor and feeling of equality of their
employers is through the excellence of the service they
render them and the courtesy (not servility) with which
they render it, that as every capitalist becomes such by
means of abstinence they may themselves by saving become
capitalists, that there is nothing in the nature of their
work or its relations to capital to cause them to hang down
their heads, that handsome is that handsome does, that the
opportune offer of the present capital to work on gives
them a chance to exhibit their skill and to earn a living,
that the capitalists are just as dependent on them as they
upon those, and that as single sellers of a valuable personal
service they daily confront on a footing of equality the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
sellers of a valuable product so created; and there is open
to them also the moral and social reflection fortified by
constant observation and experience, that no matter where
a man begins it is the end that crowns his work, that life
to all is a series of stepping-stones, that manly qualities are
appreciated everywhere, that character tells in the lowest
position however high and low are reckoned, that the poor
gain and hold friends quite as well as the rich, that there
was a certain poor wise man that saved the city by his
wisdom and gained a lasting record in consequence, that
the poor and the rich are constantly changing places in
this world, and that there is no respect of persons with
God.</p>

<p>We may see now what we are to think of some popular
remedies constantly recommended for low Wages. A
brief discussion of what is false will give us a stronger
hold of what is true. The chapter will close with relevant
reference to three current remedies.</p>

<p>1. It is being dinned into the ears of the present
generation, that Government has large functions in the
ongoings of business, that it ought sometimes to interfere
to better the rate of Wages, at least to designate a minimum
below which they shall not go, and that Government
should hold itself ready to undertake directly to carry on
certain branches of business under certain circumstances.
This scheme goes under the high-sounding name of <i>Nationalism</i>.
Richard T. Ely, Professor of Political Economy in
Johns Hopkins University, is one of the most prominent
representatives at present of this school of thought. In
his Introduction to Political Economy just published
(1889), he lays down this principle: "<i>When for any class
of business it becomes necessary to abandon the principle of
freedom in the establishment of enterprises, this business
should be entirely turned over to Government, either local,</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
<i>state, or federal, according to the nature of the undertaking.</i>"
He begins his book by attempting to hammer in the
"lesson" that as Civilization improves, coöperation takes
the place of individualism. The golden age of individualism,
he says, is among the wild tribes of Australia.
They never coöperate with each other in their economic
efforts, or in anything else. No one expects anything
from his neighbor, and every one does unto others as he
thinks they would do to him. The life there is one prolonged
scene of selfishness and fear. But as civilization
comes in, he says, individualism goes out, and coöperation
takes its place. The fine old Bentham principle of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">laissez
faire</i>, which most English thinkers for a century past have
regarded as established forever in the nature of man and
in God's plans of providence and government, is gently
tossed by Dr. Ely into the wilds of Australian barbarism.</p>

<p>There are some propositions that are <i>certainly</i> true, and
one of them is, that no man can write like that, who ever
analyzed into their elements either Economics or Politics,
who ever gained a clear conception of the sphere of either
science in its relation to the other, or who ever saw distinctly
the relations of either to the nature of Man. The
sole motive in Buying and Selling is the gain of the individual,
each for and by himself. That always was the
motive, is now, and always will be. No complications of
modern business, no complexities of credit, no combinations
of capitalists or laborers, ever altered or ever can
alter one particle the motives of men in buying and selling.
In a natural and progressive state of things, Individualism,
instead of going out, comes more and more into play,
through the Division of Labor and the falling of all sorts
of services more and more into specialties. To talk glibly,
as Professor Ely does, about Government taking up easily
and carrying on in a better way and to better ends
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
branches of pure business as they are dropped or forced
from the hands of Individuals, is ignorance at once and
alike of the real nature of Government and of Business.
Let us look at a few of the native incongruities and logical
fallacies of this nationalistic position.</p>

<p>(1) What is human Government? Is there anything
substantive and continuous in its <i>personnel</i> and purposes,
as there is in the government of God? Is government
anything more, can it be anything more, than a transient
Committee of the citizens charged and changed to do in
certain few particulars the changing will of a Majority?
Government is indeed a necessity, as men are, to restrain
the lawless, and to shape the ends of the law-abiding; but
it has to be administered, if at all, by precisely the same
kind of men as the rest are, chosen for brief periods, their
duties sharply prescribed by constitution or custom, and
impeachments or other punishments provided for them
when they transgress. One President of the United
States and one Judge of its Supreme Court have already
been solemnly impeached by the sovereign people themselves.</p>

<p>Government, then, is an <i>Agent</i>, and nothing more.
Even nationalists will not contend for the divine right of
kings. And the duties of every decent government on
earth are <i>political</i> in their character. The agents are
chosen and dismissed with a direct reference to that kind
of action. Politics has a sphere wholly distinct from
Economics. The true and only end of politics is the greatest
good of the greatest number, so far as that end can be
mediated by governmental agents of the people. Individualism
as such does indeed sink out of sight under a true
Politics, and the inalienable rights of one are maintained for
the sake of and in consistency with the greater rights of all.
But Economics is all individuals from beginning to end.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
"<i>It takes two to make a bargain.</i>" Only two. Each of
the two has his own motive, estimates for himself, gives
and takes for himself, and enjoys alone his own gain. All
this is involved in the very idea of <i>Property</i>, which is
derived from <i>proprius</i>, and which means <i>one's own</i>. How
illogical, then, and incongruous, to suppose, that a set of
limited human agents briefly trained to purely <i>political</i>
action, and liable to be turned out of office by every change
in party administration, can be competent at the same
time and in addition to perform <i>economical</i> functions for
the people!</p>

<p>Notice, too, that governmental agents in all good countries
are already <i>overburdened</i> with their mere political
duties. Work is behindhand in every portfolio, on every
court calendar, and in every legislative body, in Christendom.
How absurd it is, therefore, to talk about throwing
upon shoulders, already overburdened, additional loads of
a different kind, for which shoulders and heads are wholly
unfitted!</p>

<p>Why not, then, inquires our nationalist innovator, organize
new bureaus to undertake in their behalf the buying
and selling of the people? Ah! Who pays the taxes
needful for the support of the present <i>political</i> bureaus?
And who would have to pay the taxes needful for the support
of the new <i>economical</i> bureaus? Besides not having
any substantive existence of its own Government has not
one cent of money, except what the people voluntarily
pay in taxes out of their own personal gains, in order to
maintain their own agents to do certain political things for
them, which they cannot do as well for themselves directly;
and when it comes to the cold question for the people themselves
to answer, whether they will organize a new set of
hired men to do their trading for them, and pay them for
doing this out of aggregate gains certainly to be vastly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
diminished by the process, our nationalistic leaders will
perhaps find out that the people have common sense,
whether the said leaders have it or not.</p>

<p>But the damning difficulty with this governmental business
association is, after all, in the inevitable <i>lack of motive</i>
on the part of the hired men doing the buying and selling.
It is an honor to human nature, that hired men never have
and never can have the zeal and enterprise of principals
and owners to forecast and to perform and to lay up; because
it shows that man is a rational animal, made in the
image of his Maker, always acting under the pressure of
personal motives, and always estimating what is his own
more highly than what belongs to another. Business
motives act in their fulness only on the individual, whose
is the effort and whose is the return. Any policy whatever
on the part of Government, which lessens the number
and the eagerness of individual operators in favor of great
artificial combinations resting in the shadow of the Law,
lessens of necessity the gains of exchanges, and the progress
of the nation, because it lessens of necessity the press
of motive on the many to work and save.</p>

<p>Government, accordingly, is quite too far off in every
respect from the business, that is to say, from the buying
and selling of the people, to undertake any branch of it
when "it becomes necessary to abandon the principle of
freedom in the establishment of enterprises." It will then
be high time to "abandon" the "enterprises" themselves.
If the "principle of freedom" cannot compass the "establishment
of enterprises," is it likely that the "principle"
of secondary and irresponsible agents can do it? To show
the people how to make their bargains, how to buy and
sell and save and spend, is a function government is not
fitted for, was not established to perform, and never undertook
without making a botch of it.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span></p>

<p>In the Preamble of the Constitution of the United
States there is a careful and complete and elegant enumeration
of the purposes, which the body of the instrument
was designed to attain. These purposes are six. No one
of them contains even a hint of any purpose to enter upon
the "establishment of enterprises," still less of any
necessity "to abandon the principle of freedom." The
last of these six purposes is phrased: "<span class="smcap">and to secure
the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our
posterity.</span>" The liberty to buy and sell freely was precisely
that "liberty" of the Colonies which was most
threatened and infringed by the British Government, to
vindicate that special "liberty" was the chief cause of
the American Revolution, and "to secure the blessings" of
that and other forms of similar "liberty" was the final
purpose of the Constitution of the United States.</p>

<p>It is true indeed that the Constitution empowers Congress,
a creature of the People, "<i>to establish Post Offices
and Post Roads</i>"; but the purpose of this was <i>political</i>,
and not pecuniary; it was to bind all the States together in
one Union of intelligence and intercourse; it was to keep
the outlying and distant parts in touch with the central
and seaboard; it is not in any sense a "business" enterprise;
the department of the mails is not now and never
has been, for any length of time, self-supporting; and it
illustrates through and through in its "Star route frauds"
and other contracts, in its appointment and removal of postmasters,
and in the sickening dependence of primal Service
of the people on partisan and corrupting impulses, many
of them inherent evils of the much-vaunted Nationalism.</p>

<p>But besides all these vital and political objections to
the assumption on the part of government of any direct
industrial functions whatever, there remains two other
fundamental objections, of which the first is, that our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
national government has received no powers to any
such end, and is emphatically prohibited in the Constitution
itself from exercising them:&mdash;"<span class="smcap">The powers not
delegated to the United States by the Constitution,
nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to
the States respectively or to the people.</span>"</p>

<p>(2) The second remaining objection is, that such proposed
action of government could have no tendency at all
either to enlarge the Wages-portion, or to increase the
industrial efficiency of the laborers, or to diminish the
number of competitors at any one point of the wages-scale.
As a matter of fact, such governmental action would
have precisely the opposite effect at each of these three
vital points of wages: employers would have less motive
to swell the wages-portion, laborers less motive to improve
their capacity, and more motive to congregate locally.
Suppose, that at some given point in the scale of wages,
free and intelligent competition has been had on both sides,
and that the average rate of wages as thus determined
proves one dollar per day for each laborer. Suppose
further, that everybody outside the employers thinks this
is quite too little, and that government accordingly issues
a decree that wages at that point must be thereafter one
dollar and a half per day. That decree can have no tendency
at all to enlarge the <i>wages-portion</i> of those particular
employers, because <i>that</i> has already been determined for
the next industrial cycle by the general productiveness of
the cycle last past, and by the last division under free competition
between wages and profits; if, therefore, the
decree were carried out, as it never practically could be,
the result would be that only two-thirds of the laborers
previously employed could be employed then at all, and the
remaining third would certainly be worse off than before;
and besides the Division of Labor being necessarily lessened,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
production would be less profitable to the employers, and
the next wages-portion would certainly be less than the
one before, and thus the outcome of the <i>remedy</i> would be
worse than the <i>disease</i>. Now let alone the artificial interference
of government, and all natural accessions to
Capital at that point, all investment of profits in an enlarged
business, all saving from expenditure for the sake
of further production, tend strongly of their own accord
to enlarge the wages-portion, and thus, the number and
intelligence of the laborers continuing as before, are sure
to raise the rate of wages. Or, if there be no accessions
to Capital, or other influence swelling the wages-portion,
and the number of laborers be diminished at that point,
as by migration to new fields of effort or enlistment in
armies, the competition of wages-givers for laborers will be
quickened, and the rate of wages will rise. Reversed conditions
will of course give reversed results.</p>

<p>2. A second popular remedy for low Wages, not only
proposed, but also for a long time brought into practical
action, is Labor-Unions in their various forms and with
their manifold methods of operation upon employers. It
is important to note here and to remember, that the Guilds
of the mediæval times, from which the modern Trades-Unions
have borrowed something of form and much of
nomenclature, were in substance extremely different from
their modern imitators. Those were combinations of Masters
with their journeymen and apprentices and dependents
in order to control the entire manufacture and sale of a
certain class of products, from the name of which the
Guild usually took its own name, as "Cloth-workers'
guild," "Shoemakers' guild," and so on. Whittier, himself
a shoemaker in his boyhood, apostrophizes the latter
guild in words which more or less describe them all:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Ho! workers of the old time styled<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The gentle Craft of Leather!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Young brothers of the ancient guild,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Stand forth once more together!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Call out again your long array,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In the olden merry manner!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Once more on gay St. Crispin's day,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Fling out your blazoned banner!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>These masters thus organized with their laborers were
the capitalists of their time, and in this vital matter differed
from the Unions of to-day, which are made up of
laborers as such organized to confront, and if need be, to
antagonize, capitalists. A royal charter was indispensable
to the legal existence of those craftsmen. It took money
for them to start their guilds, and in progress of time most
of them became very rich. "A common fund was raised by
contributions among the members, which not only provided
for the trade objects of the guild; but sufficed to found
chantries and masses, and set up painted windows in the
church of their patron saint. Even at the present day the
arms of the craft-guild may often be seen blazoned in
cathedrals side by side with those of prelates and kings."
This radical difference between the two must always be
borne in mind in all arguments and inferences drawn over
from the mediæval "unions" to those of the present day.</p>

<p>Two points may be freely conceded to these labor-organizations
before we pass to the economic objections to them.
In the first place, the employers <i>set the example</i> for the
employees in a tacit if not open combination as against the
employees in their own interest and emolument. The so-called
"protective" tariff, for instance, is nothing in the
world but a strongly-linked combination of certain rich
capitalists to extort from the masses (their own laborers
included) artificially lifted prices for the necessaries of
life; and the certain result of shutting out imports by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
tariff-taxes is the shutting in of would-be exports, to the
certain lowering of general wages in a country, because
there is a lessened demand for laborers in consequence.
For a second good instance of combinations as against
employees on the part of employers, take the well-known
understanding among manufacturers of the same sort
of goods in the same general locality, that laborers discharged
from one establishment shall not be hired in any
of the rest; and that if the general voice call for a "shut
down," or for three-fourths time or less, all in that line of
goods shall comply. How can laborers be blamed for
organizations in their own behalf when they find themselves
confronted as individuals with an organization of
employers?</p>

<p>Then, too, it must be acknowledged, that, had it not
been for united action of some sort on the part of the laborers,
the unreasonable hours of fifty years ago in mills and
factories would probably not have been shortened to this
day. Capitalists as a class are conservative of methods,
as well as of ends. The cotton and woollen manufacturers
of Berkshire County, for example, who may doubtless be
taken as a fair sample of the manufacturers of New England,
stiffly refused the demands of their work-people that
the hours might be reduced from an average of 14 throughout
the year to an average of 11. When the late Civil
War was going on, and the manufacturing became extremely
profitable, and the mills were more or less depleted
by enlistment, and the remaining hands felt more independent
from the consequent rise of wages, the combined
demand in one mill for fewer hours was reinforced by
simultaneous demands for the same in other mills in the
neighborhood (the time and manner having been agreed
upon beforehand), and visits in force by the work-people
from mill to mill completed the desired reform. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
mill-owners were sullen and indignant, and submitted of
necessity. The work-men were right. The reform was
imperative. Credit must be given to them for the good
they have done acting as a body on this and other occasions.</p>

<p>On the other hand, all this is not <i>business</i>. All this is
contrary to the very old, and the very good adage, that it
takes <i>two</i> to make a bargain. If we express this adage in
the language of our science, it will take some such form
as this: When two men have mutual services to exchange,
let them come to a fair agreement as to the terms on
which they will exchange. Certainly, let each make
the best terms he can, but let the bargain always be free.
If one party, who happens to have the power to do it, uses
anything like compulsion upon the other, it ceases so far
forth to be a bargain at all, and becomes a sort of robbery,
of which in some cases courts will take cognizance. Now,
workmen bring a certain valuable service to the market,
just such a service as the capitalist wants, and he has to
offer just such a service as they want, namely, wages: let
the two parties come to a free and fair agreement on the
terms of their exchange; let each workman by all means
make the very best terms he can, insisting to the last
penny on all he can get elsewhere, for the value of his
service is determined, as other values are determined, by
what it will bring: let the employer do just the same on
his side, and so let a fair bargain for the time present be
struck. This is a very good kind of <i>striking</i>, and the
more intelligence and skill and self-respect a workman
has, the better prepared he is to strike the bargain and
secure his just due by and for himself alone; and this
gives a good chance for every man who has any peculiar
gift, who may have surpassed his fellows in diligence and
skill, to secure a proportionate reward now and to go on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
higher in future; all this gives opportunity for <i>diversity of
relative advantage</i>, which, as we have seen, lies at the basis
of all exchange, which itself starts in individualism and
naturally proceeds in a still higher individualism to the
end. This is the only way for a laborer of talent and
diligence to secure fully what belongs to <i>him</i> as a man and
a workman. If he cannot get from a given employer
what he thinks he ought to get, what he thinks the service
is worth in another market, let him exercise his perfect
right to quit and go elsewhere. All this is fair and aboveboard
and individual and progressive.</p>

<p>Everybody knows that there is a kind of <i>striking</i> now
in vogue wholly different from this, in that it brings a
sort of compulsion into play. <i>A fair bargain should be
broken, if at all, just as it was made, with the two parties
face to face, and everybody else aloof; and a new bargain
should be made, just as the old one was, with the two parties
face to face, and everybody else aloof.</i> But a combination
among workmen to leave an employer in the lurch,
and especially a combination which forces into its ranks
by cajoling or menaces those who are unwilling to join it,
as is so commonly the case in Strikes, is not only contrary
to the inmost nature of a bargain, but is also of itself a
sort of confession of the injustice of the claim. If the
claim be just so far as <i>all</i> the individuals are concerned,
there is no occasion to extort it. If the value of the
service rendered by each be equal to the sum demanded,
and especially if this can be obtained elsewhere, which is
the only gauge of the value of any service anywhere, there
is no need of conference and combination and conspiracy.
Of course, this radical argument against Strikes implies
that employers of that grade have not entered into a combination
not to hire dissatisfied laborers from other establishments;
if they have, then the agreement can be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
turned with equal force against the employers themselves,
for <i>they</i> are resorting to means outside the nature of a
bargain, means of the same nature as a Strike. Let, then,
each workman tell his employer the present facts just as
they are, and if this appeal prove ineffective to secure his
commercial right, let him go quickly where he can get
the most for his service. That this is not done, that
means of the nature of a threat are brought to bear upon
the employer, that the justice of the claim is not relied
on in a case where more than anywhere else justice can
enforce itself, that free and full explanations are not had,
that no notice is given, that great damage is expected by
their action to accrue to the employer,&mdash;all this seems to
forget that the transaction between employers and employed
is a case of pure exchange, a simple bargain of one
service against another service.</p>

<p>The above is the universal and fundamental objection
to Strikes. <i>The remedy for economical evils, real or supposed,
must ever be found in economical considerations.</i> The
strong but foolish tendency of the times is to mix up
things that are quite distinct; to try to apply to the evils
of Trade the rules of Morals, which is a useless task; to
appeal to Politics in matters of pure Bargain; and to
resort to Force to cure the evils that flow from the wholly
voluntary action of individuals. This is like the doctor
who would cure bodily ailments by mental and spiritual
recipes. It has all the absurdities of the late famous
"Mind-cure." The mind is indeed higher than the body,
but bodily maladies must be treated as such, or the
patient will die; the imperatives of Ethics are certainly
superior to the profitables of Economics, but the latter
are well able to take care of themselves on their own
ground; Religion is loftier than Morals, but it becomes a
very poor substitute for morals in the daily routine of life.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Similia similibus curantur.</i> Economical evils can only be
removed by a better Economics better applied. Strikes
are an outside and irrelevant remedy for low Wages.</p>

<p>A bad principle works badly in practice of course; the
principle that underlies strikes is so opposed to the fundamental
nature of exchange, that we might know beforehand
that it would work badly; and as a matter of fact,
it does work badly enough both upon employers and employed,
because strikes are certain to embitter the relations
between the two classes, which ought always to be cordial
and free, and especially, because strikes must work on the
minds of the capitalist to lessen the Wages-Portion for the
next industrial cycle. Fortunately, we possess authentic
statistics gathered about Strikes by the Massachusetts
Bureau of Statistics of Labor, and published in detail in
the Report of December, 1888. The information given is
exact in relation to five principal States, and approximate
in relation to the other parts of the United States. We
will copy first the table exhibiting the Losses in six years
on account of Strikes of both Employers and Employees,
and the outside assistance received by the latter:&mdash;</p>

<p>The large percentage of establishments represented in
this table, in which the strikes were ordered by labor-organizations,
is particularly noticeable. In New York 94.26%
of the establishments had strikes which were ordered, in
Illinois 83.96%, in Massachusetts 81.91%, and in the United
States 82.24%. The "walking-delegate" so-called became
the principal personage in all these strikes; he brought the
orders to the men from the "central-union" of their special
organization, and became in most cases the sole means of
communication between the two. "<i>You are the strike</i>,"
exclaimed the Lord Mayor of London the other day to Mr.
Burns, the walking delegate of the dock-laborers now on
strike in that city. That the daily bread and home comforts
of tens of thousands of men depend on the secret
and irresponsible decision of a little knot of agitators,
sending out their verbal and often ambiguous written orders
by a walking-delegate or two, is one of the monstrosities
of Strikes often witnessed in the United States. The laborers
sometimes do not know even the causes of the strike.
There has been great want and suffering for three months
past among the striking coal-miners in the State of Illinois;
and a brief editorial in the "Springfield Republican" of
Aug. 24, 1889, describes the state of things so justly, that
we quote it:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ex-Congressman William L. Scott, who owns coal
mines at Spring Valley, Ill., has offered to pay 75 cents a
ton for mining to the strikers who in their destitution have
been subsisting for some time on public charity. This is
2&#189; cents a ton more than the miners have asked for, but it
is coupled with the condition that each man must seek
work individually and not through some outside union
committee. Although the men have been reduced to a
state of abject want it is said the conditions imposed will
prevent a settlement. In that case we may conclude that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
a few well-fed walking delegates are acting for the men
and not they for themselves. It is a strange time to quibble
over such a matter. The worst and most oppressive
enemy of labor is the parasite who lives upon its distresses."</p>

<p>A strike is a state of war, and like war, there are two
parties to it, and it cannot be expected that the party of
the other part should not strike back. The "<i>lock-out</i>" is
the counter-stroke of the capitalist to the "<i>strike</i>" of the
laborer. Lock-outs, however, are comparatively infrequent.
Capitalists, as a rule, are conservative and forbearing.
Massachusetts took the statistics of lock-outs as carefully
as those of strikes, and the following is the table:&mdash;</p>

<p>Like war too, strikes and lock-outs are wasteful and
demoralizing to both parties. Why should there be a
resort to force to settle an industrial dispute any more than
to settle any other private dispute? Will such a resort be
long tolerated by public opinion in civilized countries?
The Legislature of Massachusetts in 1886 provided for a
State Board of Arbitration for the settlement of differences
between employers and employees. The statute was
crude in some respects, and the basis of it not very firmly
fixed in the nature of things, but the Bureau of Labor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
reports that it has been justified by the results in its practical
application during the short time of its operation.
The broad truth is, that the value of Commodities and the
value of Credits is now left to the safe action of Demand
and Supply under free competition in every country in
Christendom: why should not the value of Services be
left to the same safe and inexorable action? Governments
gave up long ago all idea of regulating directly or indirectly
the prices of merchandise and the prices of commercial
claims of all kinds: will they not shortly give up also all
idea of regulating directly or indirectly the rates of Wages?
They will. The three kinds of things bought and sold are
on an exact level in the nature of things, so far as Government
is concerned. Wages are abundantly able to take
care of themselves in the ordinary way, as goods do, and
stocks and bonds; and an enlightened Public Opinion is
fast coming to see, that a man's personal service rendered
needs no more the oversight of the State in its sale than
his horse, or note of hand at interest. Strikes, and lock-outs,
and all extraordinary courts or boards to settle quarrels
between a labor-giver and a labor-taker as such, since
it is a case of ordinary buying and selling, are foredoomed
to pass out in the good time coming.</p>

<p>Towards this good end works strongly the common
<i>futility</i> of strikes and lock-outs. Carroll D. Wright, chief
of the Bureau of Labor in Massachusetts, now the head of
the National Bureau of Labor, in his State Report for 1880,
gave a succinct account of all strikes in that State from
their beginning in 1830. They were 159 in all, of which
109 were unsuccessful, 18 apparently successful, 16 compromised,
6 partly successful, and 10 "result unknown."
In Great Britain during the year 1878, there occurred 277
strikes, of which 256 were failures, 17 were compromised,
and only 4 were successful. The following table taken
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
from the Massachusetts Report of 1888, gives on a broad
scale the results of Strikes in the United States for six
years:&mdash;</p>

<p>3. The third popular remedy for low Wages, which has
at least the merit of being in the line of economical considerations,
as the other two are not, is "Co-operation."
The interest in this proposed remedy is much less both in
Europe and in the United States than formerly, owing to
the failures that have mostly attended the attempts to put
the scheme into practice, although there have been some remarkable
successes also, particularly in England. The idea
of Co-operation is this, namely, that certain laborers within
given classes combine of their own accord, (1) <i>either to purchase</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
<i>their necessaries in common and at wholesale, hence at
cheaper rates because avoiding all profits of the middlemen</i>;
or (2), <i>more especially to engage in the joint production of the
commodities they are familiar with, the laborers furnishing
the capital also from their little hoards or borrowing it on the
strength of their individual or associated credit, managing the
business themselves, all being co-partners, and of course all
sharing pro rata the entire profits of the concern</i>.</p>

<p>All this is well; and in countries where laborers have
been under traditional disabilities, it may be in some cases
very promotive of their self-respect, activity, frugality, and
general welfare; but any one can see that no new economic
principle is involved in the plan. As in all other production,
so here, there must be (1) capital from some source,
(2) steady and skilful labor, and (3) superintendence or
management of the business. It is at the third point that
schemes of co-operation have mostly broken down. The
faculty of good management is rare; the organizing and
executive ability needful to carry through any scheme of
co-operation will not come upon call; if any of the co-operators
chance to possess it, the scheme may succeed, although
he who is conscious of having it will prefer to use
it for his own gain in his own way, to say nothing of the
practical impossibility of any man's working with the same
spirit when the gain or loss is to be largely another's as
when it is to be wholly his own; moreover, it has been
well said, "it is impossible <i>to hire</i> commercial genius or
the instincts of a skilful trader"; so that, while there is
no trouble about the workmen uniting the character of
capitalist and laborer in their own persons, and no doubt
that they will work harder and more skilfully while sharing
profits as well as receiving wages, it is still true, that
the difficulty of securing a real "captain of industry," and
thus a perfect organization and management of the whole
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
business, puts the scheme of co-operation out of the question
as a means of raising wages, or promoting the general
welfare of laborers.</p>

<p>In this country, where there is nothing to hinder any
laborer from becoming a capitalist, where the savings-banks
are open to the smallest gains, where nothing is more
common than for two or more workmen to organize a firm
to carry on some branch of business, where most of the
present capitalists proper were formerly laborers proper,
and where the shares of most of the joint-stock companies
are open to everybody who has the means to buy them,
there is only one consideration that seems to justify any
special jealousy of laborers as such towards capitalists as
such; and that is the fact, that Legislation, every now and
then, sometimes on a small scale and then on a gigantic
one, now by means of corporate charters and then by
other means more indirect and effective, <i>does confer certain
extraordinary privileges upon capitalists</i>. So long as capitalists
and laborers rest upon their natural rights and
positions, neither can get any undue advantage of the
other; and just so far as each recognizes their identity of
economic interest and the consequent reciprocity of obligation
and effort, the prosperity of each will help build
up the other; but, on the other hand, so far forth as any
advantages are given to capitalists by special laws, either
of State or Nation, these become necessarily unjust to
laborers, and ultimately also injurious to capitalists; and
in this case, the laborers, seeing just what it is that hurts
them, <i>ought to combine together and to strike, not capital
(their best friend), but a piece of perverted legislation (their
worst enemy)</i>.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV.<br />

<small>COMMERCIAL CREDITS.</small></h2>


<p>Political Economy is the Science of Sales; and because
it <i>is</i> the science of sales, its definitions and principles must
cover equally all cases of sales actually occurring or possible
to occur. We have seen repeatedly, that only three
kinds of things are ever bought and sold, or ever will be,
and these are Commodities and Services and Claims. The
first two kinds have been fully elucidated already in the
two preceding chapters, and it belongs to the present
chapter to explain and illustrate clearly the peculiarities of
the third kind of things salable. Ours is the only science
that has to do with the motives and facts and economic
results of all sales as such.</p>

<p>The discussions of the present chapter will proceed
orderly through the following topics:&mdash;</p>

<ul class="IX">
<li><i>The Nature of Credit.</i></li>
<li><i>The Forms of Credit.</i></li>
<li><i>The Advantages of Credit.</i></li>
<li><i>The Disadvantages of Credit.</i></li>
</ul>

<p>1. Certain things are essential in every sale of anything,
and of course are common to all sales of everything, such
as two persons and two desires and two estimates and two
renderings; while there are certain <i>peculiarities</i> in the sale
of things belonging to each of the three special classes of
things salable; for example, in the sale of a commodity
there is a rendering of a tangible object that has been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
prepared for sale in past time, and in the sale of a service a
rendering of an intangible something wholly in the present
time; while in the sale of a credit there are likewise two
peculiarities, one of them relating to future time and the
other to a special trust felt in a person by some other
person. We must now study these two peculiarities with
care; and, mastering these, we shall be master of the
Nature of Credit.</p>

<p>a. Some sales are consummated at once, the things exchanged
and the ownership in them are mutually passed
over then and there, the reciprocal satisfactions are entered
upon immediately, and there is at once an economical end.</p>

<p>For example, one neighbor sells another a peck of green
peas and takes in pay a peck of new potatoes, both vegetables
may be cooked for dinner in the respective families
the same day, and the commercial transaction is all over.
But there are other exchanges, an immense class of them,
different from these in this respect, that though the transaction
considered as a mere case of value created and
measured is then and there ended, yet considered as to the
nature of that preliminary exchange which implies and
requires another future exchange to consummate it, it is
not then and there ultimately closed, but one (or both) of
the parties then exchanging relies on the good faith of
some one else to fulfil in the future a pledge expressly
or impliedly made in the prior exchange. Commonly some
external evidence of the pledge is created and passed at
the time, but this is not essential to the validity of the
pledge itself. For example, A buys 50 bushels of wheat of
B, and B takes in pay for it A's note of hand at six months
for $75. The note is not the pledge, but it is a legal and
convenient proof of it. As a case in Value, the wheat is
sold for the pledge and the pledge is the equivalent of the
wheat. Each party rendered the other then and there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
satisfactory equivalents. All our definitions apply here
perfectly.</p>

<p>Still a further and future exchange was contemplated
by both parties at the time of making this exchange, and
as a silent part of it. A takes what is now his own wheat,
and B takes as an equivalent for what was his wheat a
right to demand of A in six months an equivalent for the
present equivalent (the pledge) for the sake of which B
rendered the wheat. The note of hand is the evidence of
this pledge, and it belongs absolutely to B. It is his property.
He may keep it till maturity and then sell it to A
for its face, or he may sell it at once to a bank for its face
less the discount for six months. Discount is the difference
between the face and the present price of a note of
hand. The first peculiarity, then, of Credit is, that it
always involves the element of future time. But it involves
this secondarily, and not primarily. In other
words, a present equivalent is always rendered by both
parties in every commercial transaction; but the present
equivalent in the case of a credit transaction is the right
to demand something of somebody sometime in the future.
This distinction is very important, as we shall see clearly
when we come to treat of Banking, though it is generally
ill-understood at present. Valuables, when they exchange
at all, exchange once for all. But there is one kind of valuables,
namely, claims, which, when subject to exchange,
imply and require another and a future exchange, not
necessarily between the parties to the first exchange, but
between <i>some</i> two parties; and not, speaking strictly, to
<i>consummate</i> the first exchange, because that took and gave
its own satisfactory equivalents; but, as involving both
time and trust, the credit sale must in the nature of things
be followed by another sale of one of the three kinds.</p>

<p>We see, accordingly, that in Credit our science of Economics
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
takes partial possession of future time for certain
purposes of its own. Exchange sets its throne and reigns
pre-eminently in present time; but its sceptre extends also
over past time, so far as all capital is concerned, and so far
as all material commodities (the result of past work) are
exposed for sale in the present; and its right hand of rule
goes forth also to grasp the future, under limitations indeed
both as to the stretch of time covered and as to the character
of the persons concerned, but still there is there a
fair domain and a broad domain, and a realm on the whole
winning a wider and wider circuit. It is one of the proud
boasts of Political Economy as a science, as it is too one of
the exalted traits of human nature, that the lordly impulse
to buy and sell does not confine itself to what the Past
offers in all its accumulated valuables, nor to what the
Present unfolds in the unlimited desires and efforts of congregated
men, but reaches out also into the Future, and
makes that pay tribute more and more into the vast treasury
of its Gains. And this too is legitimate. Man is at
once and all the time actor and historian and prophet.
The future is not wholly unknown. Given the one assumption,
that Earth and Men go on as heretofore, Exchange
knows well enough, and better and better, whom
of the coming men to trust and for how long a time. The
doctrine of averages and of probabilities comes along to
guide and to enhearten the investor. Any thoroughly
established government of to-day can borrow all the money
that it wants on its public pledge to repay the principal
fifty years hence. England has borrowed millions of
pounds sterling, giving no day certain in the future for
its repayment. These funds are called "Consolidated
Annuities": the interest on them is paid on a day nominated
in the bond: the principal is to be paid when the
borrower chooses, or never.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span></p>

<p>b. The other and final peculiarity of Credit is, that it
always involves on the part of one person a commercial
confidence in some person <i>as such</i>. The term, Credit, is
derived from the Latin <span class="smcap">Credo</span>, <i>I believe</i>, and the corresponding
term, Debt, from <span class="smcap">Debeo</span>, <i>I owe</i>. Thus the personal
element and the future element are wrapt up in the
very origin of the words. There is no credit without debt,
and no debt without credit. The very words imply a <i>belief</i>
of one of the two parties in a commercial promise made
by the other, and also an <i>obligation</i> acknowledged by this
party as due to the first. There is a basis for credit in
human nature. Faith in each other to a certain extent is
natural to men. Whatever enlarges the intellectual foresight,
and especially the moral character of men, opens a
broader and surer field for Credits. Civilization, so-called,
and Christianity certainly, deepens and broadens the natural
trust of man in man. Despite all the instances of
broken faith, and they are too many; despite the shocks
and cautions that come every now and then to every man
who trusts much in his fellow-men; experience itself justifies
and rewards an ever-growing commercial trust. It is
one of the noble things in international commerce, as we
shall see, that men trust each other across the oceans, and
lay millions of value upon the faith of a single firm. As
the core of the Christian religion is confidence in a <i>Person</i>,
so the very substance of credits is a natural and in general
well-grounded faith in <i>persons as such</i>.</p>

<p>A Credit, then, may be defined to be <i>a Right to demand
something of somebody</i>; and a Debt to be <i>an Obligation to
pay something to somebody</i>. What always lies, accordingly,
between creditors and debtors, are Rights coupled with
Obligations; and these are <i>Property</i>, just as much as anything
is and for the same reason, since they always may
be, and usually are, bought and sold by other parties as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
well as the original parties. In these Rights or Claims,
therefore, arises a commerce, domestic and foreign, immense
in extent and amount, and the Rights themselves take their
undisputed place on an equality with tangible Commodities
and personal Services.</p>

<p>Having thus reached an ultimate and satisfactory definition
of Credit, we must still pursue a little further our
present object, namely, to obtain a clear conception of the
<i>nature</i> of this great class of Valuables, by drawing two or
three distinctions between Credit-Rights and some other
rights very apt to be confounded with them.</p>

<p>(1) The distinction between credit-rights and other
rights is well rooted in the Latin language and in the
Roman law, while the corresponding English terms are
quite ambiguous and need to be used with great caution.
In Latin, a true debt is called a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Mutuum</i>, because it lies
between two persons, a creditor, and a debtor, and is a
credit-right independent of the question of fact whether
the debtor has now the thing rendered to him or not,
indeed whether he has anything at all to pay with or not;
on the other hand, a thing merely lent, when the very
thing lent is to be returned to its owner, who has not in
the meantime parted with his property to the other, is
called in Latin a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Commodatum</i>. The English tongue has
but the one word, <i>Loan</i>, for the two very distinct operations:
for the loan of a book, for instance, which is to be
returned after use, and which may be legally reclaimed
by the owner if he chance to find it anywhere, that is,
the Latin <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">commodatum</i>; and for the loan of money, or
other such measurable thing, which is to be returned <i>in
kind</i> only, and which may <i>not</i> legally be reclaimed except
through some action of the borrower, since the ownership
of that thing rendered has passed over to him completely,
that is, the Latin <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mutuum</i>. The same ambiguity of course
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
inheres in the corresponding English word, <i>Borrow</i>. The
English language is relatively poor in words expressing
nice legal distinctions.</p>

<p>Now, as a true debt is a claim on a <i>person</i> and never on
a <i>thing</i>, the Roman Law is true to the nature of things
and to the vital distinctions of our science, when it names
the right to which a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mutuum</i> gives birth as
a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">jus in personam</i>,
that is to say, a right against the person; while it
names the legal obligation arising out of a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">commodatum</i> as
a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">jus in re</i>, that is to say, a right to the very thing. So
strongly is this doctrine, namely, that the security of a
true debt lies against persons and not against things, intrenched
in the Roman Law, that debts or credits are
even termed "<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">nomina</i>," <i>names</i>, in that law, as when
Ulpian says, "<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Nomina eorum qui sub conditione vel in
diem debent et emere et vendere solemus</i>": We are accustomed
to buy and sell <span class="smcap">Debts</span> payable on a certain day and
at a certain event. The fundamental law of the present
national banks of the United States explicitly recognizes
this old and good distinction by requiring the banks to
loan money on <i>personal</i> security only, that is to say, no
tangible things, not even real estate, may be taken as
<i>original</i> security for any loan.</p>

<p>(2) Henry Dunning Macleod, who has cast fresh light
on the nature of Credit, draws another distinction that
lies on the threshold of the subject, namely, that between
paper documents conveying titles to <i>specific things</i>, such
as a bill of lading, for example, and those conveying <i>credit-rights</i>,
such as a bank-note, for example. Bills of lading
describe the goods, go out with the goods, are a title to
the goods, and have no value separate from the goods; bank-notes
have nothing to do with any specific pieces of property
anywhere, are in no proper sense a title to anything
whatever, but a general <i>claim</i> for something upon some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
person somewhere that awaits his action for its validity
and realization. For instance, a grain-dealer in Chicago sells
1,000 bushels of No. 2 wheat to a party in New York, and
ships the grain to that point by rail: two kinds of paper
documents arise in connection with this transaction, which
are quite diverse in their nature and course of operation:
one is a <i>bill of lading</i>, that goes along with the wheat, and
gives the person named in the bill a complete title to
1,000 bushels of wheat of a certain description, and the
holder of the bill takes the wheat and asks no favors of
anybody; and the other is a <i>bill of exchange</i>, drawn by the
grain-dealer in Chicago on the consignee of the wheat in
New York, which bill of exchange is sold at once by the
creditor in Chicago to a banker there, provided the banker
has commercial confidence in the two names on the bill
and a sufficient motive in the shape of a discount for buying
it: thus the bill of lading has in it neither element
of Credit, neither Time nor Trust, while the bill of exchange
has both of these elements in it.</p>

<p>(3) Attention should be called to a third distinction of
the same general nature, as between relations very different
in themselves and yet extremely liable to be confounded
with each other. Let us take a common instance:
a customer of a bank takes a package of valuables of any
kind to his banker, such as bonds and bills payable and
jewels and plate, and asks him to take care of it for the
present in his vault, subject of course to a return to him or
any one else to his order at any time: no property in these
valuables passes over to the banker, it is not a deposit in
the ordinary banking sense, the relation of debtor and creditor
does not arise as between banker and depositor, the
banker becomes Trustee or Bailee of the package, and is
bound to exercise common vigilance in the care of it, but
if it be burned or stolen extraordinarily the loss is the customer's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
and not the banker's. But now, on the other hand,
when a customer deposits in the banking sense money or
bills payable with his banker, the property in the money
and bills passes over to the banker instantly, the relation
of debtor and creditor arises, the depositor receives a credit
on the banker's books in return for the money and bills
rendered, the exchange as a mere case of value is consummated
to the profit of both parties, but the return-service
to the depositor is <i>the right to demand equivalents of the
banker at some future time</i>. In other words, it is a case in
Credit.</p>

<p>(4) As this general distinction is vital, we shall lose
nothing in the end if we make even a fourth exemplification
of it. The United States Treasury receives silver
dollars of its own minting from any person who chooses to
place them there, and gives out in token what are called
"Silver certificates" to the same amount, entitling the
bearer to take out the dollars again at will, and thus the
certificates being more convenient than the dollars and
just as valuable become a part of the money of the country.
The Treasury is bound to exercise due care in the keeping
of these silver coins, and to return them to the holders of
certificates on demand, just as the elevator and railroad
companies are under legal obligations to show diligence in
keeping and transporting the wheat of our former example;
but the United States is not <i>debtor</i> to the holders of these
certificates any more than the elevator company is <i>debtor</i>
to the wheat shipper, and consequently there is no element
of Credit in these certificates. Just so of the later gold
certificate. On the other hand, the so-called greenbacks
issued by the United States are also a part of the money
of the country, but they are <i>credit</i>-money, inasmuch as
they are a <i>promise</i> to pay to the bearer some time in the
future so many dollars. The Treasury has never kept up
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
any special fund of gold and silver, with which to redeem
the greenbacks. They rest back for their value on the
good faith of the country. The United States is <i>debtor</i> to
the bearers, and these in turn are <i>creditors</i>, and the legal-tender
quality of the greenbacks does not alter their character
as a form of pure credit. Both the elements of good
faith and future time inhere in the greenbacks, as they do
also in the bonds of the United States, while in the certificates
neither of these elements appears.</p>

<p>However, circumstances easily conceivable and which
were actually realized in the case of the famous Bank of
Amsterdam, founded in 1609, might make the United
States a debtor and the holders of the silver certificates
creditors in the commercial sense of those terms. The
Directors of the Bank of Amsterdam, towards the close of
the second century of its beneficent existence, loaned out
to the Dutch East India Company and to the City of
Amsterdam large parts of the bullion, on which its certificates
("bank money") were based, unknown to the public,
which felt unlimited confidence in the bank, and the result
was in 1795, when the French invaded Holland and the
facts became known, that bank money which had previously
borne a premium of 5% fell at once to a discount of
16%, although the bullion that remained and the debts
due the Bank were fully equal to redeem the certificates
and were used for that purpose. So, if the United States
should use, clandestinely or otherwise, the silver dollars for
other purposes than to redeem the certificates on demand,
the latter would undoubtedly both in law and fact be transformed
from mere token-money (as now) into credit-money
valid as against the United States as debtor, like the greenbacks
at present.</p>

<p>Have we now compassed our first object? Do we fully
understand, from the foregoing descriptions and distinctions,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
the <i>Nature</i> of Credit? If so, we are prepared to look
narrowly into its <i>Forms</i>.</p>

<p>2. Credit-rights are commonly, but not always, recorded
upon paper; but it is important to observe, that the paper-document
is the mere evidence of the right, and not the
right itself, which lies back of the paper as substance to
shadow, and persists intact even were the paper lost or
destroyed. These paper instruments of Credit are commonly
contemplated as of two kinds, Promises to pay and
Orders to pay, but there is not at bottom any radical difference
between these, the Right as between two persons is
not affected by this superficial difference, as we shall see,
and the present enumeration of credit-forms will proceed
independently of it.</p>

<p><i>a.</i> Book Accounts. A charge in a trader's books is both
a current and a legal evidence that the person charged has
received a certain service, and has virtually promised to
render the sum charged as a return-service. Book accounts
are the most common of the forms of credit; and if the
person charged fails of his own accord to complete the
exchange thus commenced, the law, in the absence of any
proof to make the charge suspicious, collects it, if possible,
and forcibly completes the exchange. The convenience of
this form of credit is so great, that it is not likely ever to be
disused; and as between people who deal much with each
other is very useful, inasmuch as their respective book
accounts are set against each other in settlement, and only
balances are required to be cancelled in money. It is for
the benefit of both creditors and debtors, however, even
when the same parties are both creditor and debtor, that
such credits should be short in time and such settlements
frequent, since in book accounts there is no interest on
charges however long they run, and since in this way only
can the creditor realize the full gain of the exchange, and

the debtor keep fair his mercantile name. If it be difficult
or impossible to follow strictly the excellent financial
maxim, "Pay as you go," the next best thing to that is,
"Go and pay." The gains of an exchange are lessened,
or its terms become more onerous, just in proportion as
delay in its completion is experienced or expected. Book
accounts are subject also to this disadvantage as compared
with other forms of credit, that their number and amount
as against any person are less likely to become publicly
known, and therefore he is more likely to be trusted in
this form by others beyond the point of his solvency and
their safety.</p>

<p><i>b.</i> Promissory Notes. These differ from Book accounts
in that they are always either expressly or virtually on
interest, and are consequently negotiable. They are issued
by individuals, corporations, and Nations. If the principal
be deemed secure, that is, if there be a thorough trust on
the part of the holder in the maker of the note, the time
of the payment of the principal becomes a matter of comparative
indifference, because the interest is compensation
for delay, and is often the motive on the part of the holder
for rendering that service of which the note is evidence.
Indeed a long obligation, other things being equal, is commonly
preferred to a short one, and bears a higher price.
When a note is sold (negotiated) by the original holder
it becomes payable to the purchaser, or to each subsequent
purchaser in turn, and thus may run a devious round, may
play a part in many commercial transactions, may be set
off by the transient holder against a debt owed by him and
thus cancel that, and when itself is cancelled by ultimate
set-off or by any other mode of payment the last holder
takes the return for the service originally rendered by
the first holder. The promissory notes of individuals are
frequently discounted by Banks in a manner to be presently
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
explained. These are always for short times, and are debts
bought by banks on the personal security of the names
upon the notes. The notes are founded on the relation
of debtor and creditor, which is always a personal relation,
and so differ in their nature from a <i>mortgage</i>, which is a
qualified <i>title</i> to a specific piece of property, usually real
estate. A note secured by a mortgage is, as it were,
absorbed into the mortgage, and becomes another thing
from a common promissory note, or <i>commercial paper</i>, as it
is called. A mortgage rests therefore on other grounds
than a commercial trust in the good faith of a <i>person</i>.</p>

<p>Corporations also issue promissory notes, and as such
issuers become in a sense <i>moral persons</i> entitled to confidence
according to the character and purposes of the
individual corporators and the financial means and methods
of the corporation itself. It is an old saying, that "corporations
have no souls"; economists as such have no need
to pronounce on that proposition; the fact is enough for
them, that the short notes of corporations are often discounted
by bankers on the same ground as the notes of
individuals are discounted; and that their long-time obligations,
commonly called <i>Bonds</i>, are all the time bought and
sold in the market like commodities. Many of the Railroad
bonds, of which immense quantities are in the markets
of the world, rest back also for their security upon <i>Mortgages</i>
of the real estate of the corporations made over to
Trustees to hold for the assurance of the holders of the
bonds. The personal obligation of the corporators is thus reinforced,
much as a common mortgage reinforces the note
or bond, to secure which the mortgage is executed. Whenever
<i>all</i> the real estate of a railroad company becomes subject
to a mortgage, when there are previous partial mortgages
or liens, these latter take precedence in due order of
any subsequent pledges or bonds secured by what is properly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
called the <i>consolidated mortgage</i>. Such a mortgage has
recently been executed by the Northern Pacific Railroad
Company for $160,000,000. Railroad Bonds so fortified in
proper and legal terms possess the highest possible credit-security
to their holders. When no such consolidated or
"blanket" mortgage has been put on the property, first
and second and third mortgages sometimes support bonds of
primary and secondary and tertiary validity; and sometimes
so-called <i>Income-bonds</i> are issued, with or without mortgages
behind them, for the payment of the interest on which bonds
the net earnings of the corporations are specifically pledged.
Frequently also simple long-time bonds resting on corporation
security only are negotiated without difficulty.</p>

<p>It must be constantly borne in mind, that certificates of
Stock in railroad and all other similar corporations are
not credit-documents at all, but are mere evidences of so
much proportional <i>ownership</i> in the corporate property.
They are not interest-bearing documents at all, although
they may draw interest or rather dividends, if the property
be prosperous. They are somewhat like deeds to land, in
which no element of credit inheres.</p>

<p>Nations too are moral persons in the same loose though
binding sense as corporations, and as such often issue promissory
notes on interest, commonly called in this country
Bonds, in Great Britain Funds, and in some countries
Stocks. These are always pure credit. Nations give no
mortgages. Yet they often borrow at a less rate of interest
than the most solvent individuals or corporations can, as is
seen by the fact, that British consols carry but 3%, and yet
bear a premium in the present market. The term, "consols,"
is a popular contraction of "consolidated annuities,"
the Act to create which at 3%, out of a then confused
mass of public debts at various rates of interest passed
Parliament in 1757. The maximum of the British debt
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
was $4,500,000,000 in 1815, and has now decreased to
$3,467,787,960.</p>

<p>The United States also sold its bonds at 3% for a small
premium in 1882. It had borrowed of its own citizens in
1862-65, both inclusive, about $2,500,000,000 on its bonds
at different rates of interest and at different times of repayment:
some of these bore gold interest at 6% annually,
Government reserving the right to pay the principal in five
years and pledging itself to pay it twenty years from date,
and so these bonds were called "Five-twenties"; others
bore gold interest at 5%, becoming payable at ten and
demandable at forty years, and so were called "Ten-forties";
and still others bore greenback interest at 7&nbsp;<sup><big>30</big></sup>&frasl;<sub><big>100</big></sub>%,
the principal payable in greenbacks at three years, or fundable
in gold sixes, at the option of the holders, and these
were named "Seven-thirties." Over $90,000,000 of this
last kind of bonds were subscribed for by the American
people in the course of a single week in the spring of 1865.
The whole of our national debt issued prior to 1865 was
made payable on a day certain; the so-called "consols"
of 1865 and 1867 and 1868 were payable <i>not more</i> than
forty years from date; while all the bonds authorized from
1870 to 1882 were Consols proper, whose peculiarity is,
that they never fall due so as to become a claim for the
principal against the Government, but after a day fixed or
on a condition fixed are payable "at the pleasure of the
United States."<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>The separate States of our Union, as sovereign in their
own sphere quite as much as the national Government is
sovereign in its sphere, have unlimited power to contract
debts for State purposes through their regularly constituted
authorities; and consequently to issue promissory
notes or bonds to liquidate such debts. New York commenced
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
in this way in 1817 the magnificent enterprise of
the Erie Canal, to connect the great Lakes with the city of
New York by an inland water-way for commerce, and the
completion of this in 1825 made the State the "Empire
State," and the city the undisputed commercial metropolis
of the Union. In a similar way Massachusetts undertook
in 1862 the completion of the Hoosac Tunnel for a railway
lengthwise of the State; and although the process became
unduly expensive, and great abuses sprang up in connection
with it, no one now questions that the pecuniary and
moral resources of the State have been augmented, on the
whole, by contracting the debt and providing by taxation
for the liquidation of both interest and principal. The
credit of Massachusetts, that is, the ability to borrow
money at low rates of interest, has been at times greater
than that of the United States; mainly because the State in
1862 and onwards refused to avail itself of a depreciated
national paper-money (greenbacks) made legal tender for
all debts, with which to pay the interest on its then existing
State debt, but persisted throughout (alone of the
States) to pay that interest so soon as due in gold coin.
On the other hand, several of the States of the Union at
different times, and under more or less of provocation and
justification, have made a partial or entire repudiation of
certain portions of their public debts, justly damaging to
their individual credit, and even to the good name abroad
of the whole people of the United States.</p>

<p>Counties and cities and towns may also issue interest-bearing
bonds for public improvements, which have a <i>quasi</i>
governmental character, but only under conditions and to
a maximum amount prescribed by a law of the State.</p>

<p><i>c.</i> Bank Bills. These are a form of promissory notes
not on interest, and thus differ from the notes of ordinary
corporations, and from the bonds of nations and states and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
municipalities; but the issuing Bank offers, as a sort of
compensation for the privilege of circulating notes not
on interest, to convert them into coin, that is, to pay them
instantly on the demand of any holder. It is this proffered
and immediate convertibility into coin that enables the
promissory notes of a bank to circulate as money, while
the notes of other corporations and individuals equally
solid and solvent do not circulate as money. It must be
borne in mind, however, that this offer to convert them
into the legal and ultimate coin-money does not essentially
alter the nature of Bank Bills; they are a form of commercial
credit; and although they are commonly issued
against another form of such credit, namely, against the
interest-bearing promissory notes of individuals and corporations
who resort to the bank for discount, this only
complicates the exchange without changing its nature. It
is a common instance of exchanging one form of credit for
another form which happens to have a greater currency
or validity than the first, and for this superiority of the
bank credit the individual credit pays an interest, in other
words, is discounted; and such exchanges of one form of
paper credit for another, with or without a premium, may
go on indefinitely; especially as <i>credit-money</i> in the form
of bank bills, such paper may serve as a medium in many
exchanges; but ultimately, and before the entire series of
transactions is closed, such bank bills are to be redeemed in
coin, or taken in by the banker in payment of some debt
due to him, in both which cases they are extinguished as an
instrument of Credit.</p>

<p>The Bank of England keeps out in circulation on the
average £25,000,000 in bank bills. It has been computed,
that the average length of life of a Bank of England bill
between its issue and redemption is about three days; and
no bill once redeemed or received back over the counters
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
of the Bank is ever issued again. It is then placed on file
for record only. The joint-stock and private banks of
England and Wales circulate on the average rather more
than £4,000,000 of bank bills of their own; and no bank
bill of any kind is legal in England and Wales of a less
denomination than £5. The ten Scotch banks and their
branches keep out in bills about £5,000,000; six out of
the nine Irish banks and their branches issue on the
average not far from £10,000,000; but both the Scotch and
Irish banks are allowed to put out £1 bills.</p>

<p>Bank bills, as a form of paper credit not on interest, but
ostensibly redeemable in coin on demand of the holder,
have been issued in the United States by more parties and
to a larger extent and with more recklessness as to redemption
than in any other country. Omitting all reference to
Colonial issues, and confining the outlook to the first century
under the Constitution, let us note, that when the
present national government went into operation in 1789,
the "Bank of North America" in Philadelphia and the
"Bank of New York" in New York and the "Bank of
Massachusetts" in Boston had been opened for business,
and all three were State banks issuing bills convertible into
coin, though each confined its business mostly to the city
in which it was located. Two years later under the
auspices of Alexander Hamilton, then Secretary of the
Treasury, the first "United States Bank" went into operation
at Philadelphia under a charter from Congress that
was to run twenty years with a capital stock of $10,000,000.
At first no bills were issued by this bank of a less denomination
than $10; the money was popular and was converted
on demand; the Bank was prosperous, and paid dividends
to stockholders never falling below 8% and frequently
rising to 10% annually; as the time approached for the
charter to expire, the stockholders were anxious for a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
renewal of their privileges; but the opposition to them in
Congress was now strong, owing mainly to the increase in
the number of State banks from 3 to 88; and accordingly
the recharter was defeated in the House by one vote, and
in the Senate also, by the casting vote of the Vice-President,
and the Bank was obliged to wind up its affairs in
1811.</p>

<p>Then came in a sort of mania for the creation of new
State banks, under the hope that these, now there was no
National Bank, might obtain the Custody and temporary
use of the national funds, and especially might furnish the
country with paper money in the shape of State bank bills.
The number of banks went up to 246 in 1816. So many
bank bills were put out, and became so much distrusted,
and so many were presented for redemption, that the banks
could not respond in coin, and in the fall of 1814, there
was a general stoppage of specie payment in all the banks
of the Country excepting those in New England. General
resumption of specie payment by the banks did not take
place till 1819. New York bank bills went down to 90%,
those of Philadelphia to 82%, those of Baltimore to 80%,
and those of Pittsburg to 75%.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances the Second Bank of the
United States went into operation in January, 1817, also
with a charter to run twenty years, with a capital stock of
$35,000,000, of which the national Government subscribed
one-fifth. The new Bank helped indeed the State banks
to resume specie payments, as was a part of the purpose,
but it pushed its own bills into circulation with such eagerness,
that it is thought $100,000,000 of them were in the
hands of the people, before the first year was out. In this
way the Bank fell into difficulties. Its bills were distrusted.
Coin came to bear a premium over them of 10%. President
Jackson began his famous contest with the Bank seven
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
years before its charter was to expire, and took care that it
went out of being the same year that he went out of office,
in 1837, namely.</p>

<p>The next year the State banks increased in number to
675, and continued to increase till 1862, when there were
over 1500 of them, and when the issue of the "Greenbacks"
by the national Government interfered with what had been
their exclusive issuing of the paper money after 1837. In
1857, before the commercial panic of that year, the aggregate
of their bills stood at $214,000,000, the largest it ever
reached. These bills were nominally convertible into coin
at the will of the holders, but they were never actually so
convertible for any great length of time. The ratio of
their volume to the specie reserved to redeem it was always
a very high ratio. For instance, the average for the whole
country in January, 1863, was 4:1; in Rhode Island 12:1;
and in Vermont 28:1. Such a paper money can be called
convertible only by a stretch of courtesy.</p>

<p>It was wisely determined by the People to abandon this
loose form of paper money, and in 1863 went into operation
the present national banking system, under which
originally $300,000,000 of bank bills were authorized to be
issued in the aggregate, but this limit was extended in 1870
to $354,000,000, and the Act of 1875 removed all restrictions
on the total amount, while there have always been
restrictions on the amount that can be issued by any <i>one</i>
bank in the system. By the law of 1882, national banks
may withdraw their bills by depositing lawful money in the
Treasury to take them up, and then take back the proportionate
amount of the bonds held for the security of the
bills. There were outstanding Dec. 26, 1883, $341,320,256
of these national bank bills, but their volume declined
under the law of 1882 to $151,702,809 on Oct. 4, 1888.
These bills were from the first redeemable in greenbacks,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
which were themselves, however, irredeemable in gold and
silver till New Year's, 1879, since which time till the present
all the paper money of the United States of both kinds
has been convertible into coin at the will of the holder.</p>

<p><i>d.</i> Bank Deposits. We are studying in order the forms
of commercial Credits, and we have now come to that one
which is central in the operations of Banking, and accordingly
this is the place for us to understand clearly what a
Bank is, who a Banker is, and what are the motives actuating
at once the Banker and his Customers. <span class="smcap">A Bank is
an institution for the Creation, Management, and
Extinction of Credits.</span> Money of any kind plays a very
subordinate part in the general operations of banks, which
live and move and have their being in the sphere of pure
Credits. <i>Bankers are buyers and sellers of credits.</i> As merchants
are dealers in commodities, so bankers are dealers
in credits, buying (1) some credits with other credits,
(2) some credits with money, and (3) money also with
credits. Before unfolding these three operations of bankers
in their motives and profits, a glance backward to the
origin of banks would be a help to us in grasping their
nature and benefits.</p>

<p>The word "bank" meant originally a mass or pile or
ridge of earth, as we still say, a <i>sand-bank</i>, and the <i>banks</i>
of a river. When first applied to commercial transactions,
the word had a different meaning from what it has at present,
although the idea of <i>credit</i> has inhered in it from the
first: in 1171, the Republic of Venice, being at war,
ordered a forced loan from its citizens, and promised to
pay interest on it at 5%; and certificates were issued for
the sums paid in, and public commissioners were appointed
to manage the payment of the interest and the transfers of
the certificates, which were made negotiable. The Italian
word applied to such a public loan is <i>monte</i>, but as the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
Germans were then strong in Italy, the German equivalent
word, <i>bank</i>, came to be used alongside of it and instead of
it. It meant this common contribution of the citizens to
the wants of the State, represented by the mass of the certificates,
and came to be applied also to the <i>place</i> where the
commissioners paid the interest and transferred the shares.
Two other such loans were contracted there afterwards,
and an English writer, in 1646, quoted by Macleod, speaks
of the "<i>three bankes of Venice</i>," meaning these three public
debts, including the evidences of them and the place
where they were managed.</p>

<p>The Bank of England also was in its origin in 1694 an
incorporation of those persons willing to subscribe to a
public loan in time of stress, as "The Governer and Company
of the Bank of England." The subscribers to a loan
of £1,200,000 became an association, or bank, on the condition
that the Government should pay interest to the lenders
at 8% annually, and also £4000 a year in addition for the
management of the bank, that is, of this debt of £1,200,000
which was the sole capital stock of the new Company,
which was authorized to issue an equivalent amount of
bank bills to circulate as money. The capital stock was
of no use, so far as redeeming these bills was concerned,
the stockholders must furnish other money for that purpose
besides what they have loaned to the State, but the
ownership of so much of the public debt divided among
the shareholders, made the Bank respectable, and tended
to give public credit to its bills, which at first were paid
promptly in coin on demand, and thus the Bank, by increasing
the volume of money and by showing confidence
in the stability of the State, strengthened the revolutionary
position of William and Mary, and consequently the
Whigs were the friends and the Jacobites the enemies of
the Bank. This function of issuing bills or promissory
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
notes designed to circulate as money, thus begun and still
continued by the Bank of England, is much less important
in modern banking than the other two functions of receiving
Deposits and making Discounts, but it was the function
on which the turn began to be made from the older
to the newer modes of Banking. All that is needful to be
said on this tertiary or money-issuing function of Banks
has been already urged under the last head.</p>

<p>The two Banks of the United States in succession, as
they were more or less modelled after the Bank of England,
gave the same prominence to the function of issuing
paper money, under the belief that government bonds
afford the best security for the redemption of bank bills,
an idea that underlies our present system of National
Banks also; and, moreover, those two great banks began
to teach the people of the United States something of the
mysteries of <i>Deposit-banking</i>, the point that we have now
in hand. One-fifth of the capital stock of the first Bank,
$2,000,000 out of $10,000,000, was subscribed by the
national Government; and besides, the proceeds of the national
taxes as they were paid in were passed over to the
Bank as <i>Deposits</i>, that is to say, the Bank bought this
money of the Government, paying for it with a Credit;
and then properly used the money as its own in paying
expenses and in discounting paper. Bank deposits do not
belong to the depositors, but to the bank; which has thus
bought money with credit; and when Andrew Jackson
suddenly removed from the second Bank of the United
States the national moneys deposited there, and placed
them "in the custody," as he expressed it, of certain
selected State banks, these amounted at the moment to
$10,000,000, and the discount line resting in part on these
deposits was at the time over $60,000,000, he removed
them under a strong misapprehension <i>of the nature of such</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
<i>deposits</i>; and their <i>removal</i> affected credit, and disarranged
business to a remarkable degree, and caused intense excitement
all over the Union. Depositing those national
moneys with the Bank was a <i>trade</i> between the Government
and the Bank for the time being. The Government
took in return for the moneys a Right to demand of the
Bank in future by cheque or otherwise sums at its convenience
to the aggregate of the sums deposited; the
moneys became the property of the Bank to be used at its
discretion in its ordinary business; the Government took
its return-service for the moneys in a Credit, that is, a right
to draw out at its convenience in the future corresponding
sums; there was a commercial understanding in that case
between the Government and the Bank underlying the
buying and selling involved in the Deposit, as there always
is between depositors and their banks; the banks are
always bound to order their business in such a way as to
be able to respond to every depositor's call for money,
when it comes; but banks in general find practically that
a cash reserve of one-third of their Deposits is ample to
answer the current demands of their depositors, and the
remaining two-thirds may be safely used in discounting
short-time commercial paper to their own profit; Deposits,
accordingly, are not placed "in the custody" of the banks
receiving them; they are really bought by the banks of
their customers, who receive in return certain privileges
and credits that they prefer to the "custody" of their own
moneys; and under these general motives on both sides,
there has grown up in all commercial countries an immense
line of Bank Deposits so-called, and perhaps we may say
that the principal function of banks at present is to buy
these deposits with their Credit, and then to handle them
in further operations to the convenience of their customers
and to their own gain.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span></p>

<p>Under our present national banking system the Government
is still a depositor of public moneys in some of
the banks designated as "depositaries." At the close of
the fiscal year, 1888, there were 290 of such depositary
national banks, and the Treasurer held United States bonds
of the face value of $56,128,000 and the market value of
$68,668,182 in trust for these banks to secure public
moneys lodged with them. This system of national
deposit with the banks began in 1864. The total held by
the banks June 30, 1888, was $58,712,511, an increase
during the year of $35,395,633.</p>

<p>But our concern is especially with the Bank Deposits
of individuals, with their motives in making these, and
with the motives and the methods of the bankers in handling
them. In order to draw the confidence of the people
in its locality, a bank must not only be, but also <i>seem</i> to
be, well-to-do and prosperous. Most bankers find it to
their account to become known owners of public stocks;
and in many cases, as in the present national banks of this
country, are required by law to own such stocks, and this
gives them a kind of credit and public standing scarcely
to be reached by the ownership of ordinary property.
Thus the Bank of England held at the outset £1,200,000,
and now holds £15,000,000 of securities, mostly of the
public debt of England. As merchants begin by laying
in stocks of goods of the kinds they purpose to deal in and
offering them for sale, so bankers begin by bringing
together money and credits of their own in order to attract
to themselves in the way of buying and selling the money
and credits of other people. In order to deal successfully
in credits the banker must have <i>credit</i>, that is, he must
have the reputation of having property of his own, and of
being an honest and careful manager of his own affairs and
of the affairs of others so far as they are intrusted to him.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
Each of our present national banks, now (1890) 3150 in
number, must have by law a paid-up capital of not less
than $100,000, and in cities of 50,000 people their capital
must not be less than $200,000 each, except that in
places having less than 6000 inhabitants banks with not
less than $50,000 capital <i>may be</i> organized at the discretion
of the Secretary of the Treasury. The main purpose of
all this is to secure strong financial organizations fitted to
draw the confidence of the communities in which they are
placed, and in this manner and by means also of constant
national supervision to attract the Deposits of the people
to the banks.</p>

<p>Now, as was said a little while ago, perhaps the central
function in banking is for the banker to receive his customer's
money and also his credits falling due, and to
render to him in return for these <i>a credit</i>, that is, a right
to demand from himself an equal sum at a future time
or times. The evidence of this right is entered on the
banker's books, and usually too on the customer's passbook,
and thus becomes what is called a <span class="smcap">Deposit</span>. The
ownership of the money and of the credits deposited
passes over completely from the customer to the banker.
It is a complete case of buying and selling to the mutual
profit of the parties. The banker has the right to do just
what he pleases with his deposits, and the customer has a
right to draw cheques on his credit as and when he
pleases; only the banker's entry of the transaction on his
books is a virtual and a legal <i>promise</i> to pay that amount
to his customer, and therefore he must be ready to respond
to his customer's call, whenever the latter demands,
not his own money, but so much of his banker's money.
<i>A deposit, accordingly, is not the very thing deposited, but
a credit.</i> It is the banker's promise and the depositor's
property. It is in this way that a banker buys ready
money with a credit.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span></p>

<p>The motive, then, that leads the depositor to intrust his
money to the banker is the desire, not to have that specific
money kept safely for him, for he lost possession of it
absolutely when it passed the counter, he <i>sold</i> it and took
his pay in something else, but rather to have the unquestioned
right to call on the banker for such sums (not to
exceed the deposit in the aggregate) and at such times as
may suit his own convenience. He has such confidence
in the integrity and solvency of the banker, finds it so
practically convenient to have dealings with him, and
comes to have certain minor privileges at the bank in
other relations over non-depositors, that he quite prefers a
credit on the banker to the possession of the money itself.</p>

<p>The corresponding motive of the banker to receive his
customer's funds on these terms is that he finds by experience
(his own and others'), that he can safely use a
large portion of these moneys deposited in other operations
in credit profitable to himself, and at the same time
be practically sure of meeting all his customer's calls for
money as they are made. Every good banker finds out,
that many of his customers wish always to leave a balance
in his hands; that while some of them are constantly
drawing cheques on him for cash, others of them are as
constantly depositing with him in cash; and that consequently
he can properly and safely use a large part of
the money he has purchased with his credit to purchase
other credits with. Deposit-banking, therefore, is not only
convenient and profitable for the depositor, but also
excellent and profitable for the banker.</p>

<p>Besides these two parties benefited, there is a gain, too,
for the community at large in deposit-banking; inasmuch
as a new capital as such has been thereby created, a series of
new values, which would not otherwise have existed at all.
Were there no deposit-bank in that locality, every man now
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
a customer of it would of course keep his own reserves for
himself for prospective contingencies: now, all these little
reserves are aggregated in the bank, the convenience of
them for each customer's contingencies is just as great as if
he kept his own in his own safe or wallet, but the banker
finds that he can use, say two-thirds of the whole, and still
answer each customer's call. Here is a new capital. Here
are scattered valuables brought together to be loaned out
to a profit, which were otherwise barren and useless for
the time being. Industry is quickened in a wide circle,
products are created and brought to market, wages are
paid and profits are gained, in direct consequence of bringing
together under favorable auspices for safe loaning the
little hoards and driblets of many individuals, which were
practically useless in isolated hands.</p>

<p>It may easily be objected at this point, that it is entirely
possible that any banker might be called upon to pay off
all his deposit-liabilities at once in money, which, if it happened,
would break him of course; so it is abstractly possible
that all the lives insured in a Life Insurance Company
might terminate in one day, in which case no Company in
the world could meet its obligations; and so it is abstractly
possible that all the houses insured in a Fire Insurance
Company might be burned up in a single night, which, if it
happened, would cause the collapse of the soundest company;
but in all these cases of possibility there is a <i>certainty</i>
that the possibility will not become a fact. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ex nihilo nihil fit.</i>
A supposition practically impossible to become a fact can
yield no logical inference whatever. The Greek language
has a special grammatical form for a hypothesis impossible
to be realized in fact: would that the English had also
such a form of speech! It would save us a mess of bad
reasoning. If, however, any banker may have misjudged
for his locality at any time the proper ratio of reserves kept
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
to deposits received, and be crowded in consequence, he
must sell some of the securities bought with the excess, or
borrow money on them.</p>

<p>Surprisingly large is the amount of bank deposits in all
the leading commercial nations of the world. The average
public and private deposits of the Bank of England, on
which no current interest is paid by the Bank, amounts to
about £40,000,000 all the time. The ten joint-stock banks
of London carry about £80,000,000 in private deposits, of
which those to remain some time <i>draw</i> an interest, but
those lodged on current accounts and on call <i>draw</i> none.
Scotland has carried deposit-banking further and to greater
advantage than any other country in the world. There are
now no private banks in Scotland, but the ten joint-stock
banks with their numerous branches scattered to every village
in the land hold constantly about £70,000,000 as
individual deposits, on which current interest is allowed,
and so the habit of keeping one's account with a banker
has become universal with the people. No one thinks of
keeping money to any amount in his house or about his
person, and consequently house-breaking and highway
robbery have almost ceased. Bankers even attend all
the great fairs in the country to receive deposits and to
pay off cheques. Credit in this form and in another form
soon to be described treads its utmost verge in Scotland.
Although in the United States the custom of keeping deposits
with bankers and drawing cheques against them has not
gone nearly so far as in Scotland, and not nearly so far as
it will go in the immediate future, yet the aggregate of
individual deposits in the national banks alone, Oct. 4, 1888,
was $1,350,320,861, an increase in just seven years of 26%.</p>

<p><i>e.</i> Bank Discounts. The credits that are discounted by
bankers may be either the promissory notes of individuals
and corporations already characterized, or the Bills of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
Exchange soon to be characterized, but the entire function
of discount is so peculiar, that the paper subjected to it
ought to be enumerated in a classification of the instruments
of Credit. The discounting of commercial paper is
the second essential function of banking, as the buying
and handling of deposits is the first; and it is more in
accordance with genuine <i>banking</i> to pass the price of the
paper discounted to the seller's credit in the form of a
deposit, that is, to buy one credit by creating another, than
to pay the money over the counter at once, and thus to
buy credits with money. Those who do the latter are
called <i>bill-discounters</i> rather than bankers, but most of our
bankers do both, though there is a tendency towards the
separation of the two in this country also.</p>

<p>Manufacturers and wholesale merchants usually sell
their goods <i>on time</i>, as it is called, say three or six months.
Debts are thus created, or to say the same thing in other
words, Credits are thus given. The manufacturer or wholesaler
is creditor and the jobber or retailer is debtor. But
a debt is property; and the creditor in this case wishes to
avail himself of his property at once for further production;
so he either takes a Promissory Note from his debtor,
or draws a Bill of Exchange upon him, and this piece of
property is ready for sale. Neither piece mentions <i>interest</i>
expressly, but the face sum virtually covers it as contemplating
discount. Banks have been organized for the
express purpose of buying for their own profit and for the
convenience of business such pieces of property; some
banker, accordingly, buys this particular piece, that is to
say, this creditor passes over to this banker the commercial
right to demand payment from this debtor at the end of
three months, and receives in return from the banker either
money direct or so much of the banker's credit, that is, a
deposit in favor of the creditor on the banker's books.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
For furnishing this creditor either with ready money or
a more available credit in lieu of his mercantile paper, the
banker charges of course <i>a percentage</i>. This is <i>Discount</i>.
<i>Discount is the difference between the face and the price of
the paper.</i> This percentage called discount is the chief
source of profit in ordinary banking. It is virtually compound
interest on the sum advanced till the maturity of
the paper, when the banker realizes from the debtor its full
face.</p>

<p>The following is a common form of a bankable note:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<span class="rspace">$1,000</span><span class="smcap lspace">Williamstown</span>, Mass., Nov. 10, 1889.<br />
</p>

<p>Three months after date I promise to pay to the order of <span class="smcap">Joshua
Swan</span>, one thousand dollars, payable at the Williamstown National Bank,
value received.</p>

<p>
<span class="rspace">Due Feb. <sup><big>10</big></sup>&frasl;<sub><big>13</big></sub>.</span>
<span class="smcap lspace">Leander Allen.</span><br />
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When Swan has put his name on the back of this note,
that is in bank phrase, has <i>indorsed</i> it, in token that he
thereby at once sells and guarantees it to the bank, it is
then discounted on the strength of the two <i>names</i>, Allen
and Swan. As Allen technically takes the advance from
the bank for his own benefit, he is technically expected to
take up the note when it matures, and if he do not, the
bank falls back on Swan, who is equally bound with Allen
to see that it is paid at the proper time. Two names
are nearly always, not always, requisite to a note acceptable
for discount at a bank; and more names merely
strengthen the note, since it is discounted on the combined
validity of all the names upon it.</p>

<p>One obvious advantage of discount is, that it tends to
make all capital active and thus productive. It enables
the banks to sell their credit and make a gain, to use a part
of their money deposits to buy mercantile paper with, and
so get a bank interest on them; it enables dealers in commodities
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
to realize in cash <i>minus</i> the discount the sum of
what they have sold <i>on time</i>; and by means of <i>accommodation</i>
notes or bills, which only differ from the others in
that there is no <i>actual</i> debt between the parties, business
men may swell the volume of their business temporarily,
and non-business people may borrow small sums for convenience
or emergencies. Bankers have not always credit
enough or money enough from their depositors to buy in
either mode all the good paper that is offered to them, in
which case, they raise the rate of discount unless the law
forbids, or by easy evasions even when the law forbids; or
else accommodate regular customers and large depositors
first, or buy of all that are "good" a certain proportion
only.</p>

<p>The discount line of 3140 national banks reporting
Oct. 4, 1888, was $1,674,886,285.29.</p>

<p>It is thus through the purchase of discountable notes for
money, that banks derive their partial character as money-lenders.
Also, such reserve sums as they do not wish
to invest in negotiable paper, on account of the time involved
before such paper matures, banks frequently loan
<i>on call</i> to those customers who have good collateral securities
to pledge for the repayment of such loans. The
terms of such a contract give the bank full authority to
sell such collateral "<i>at the Brokers' Board or at public or
private sale, or otherwise at said bank's option, on the non-performance
of this promise, and without notice</i>." So far
forth banks become direct money-lenders. It ought also
to be added, that promissory notes with a single name (or
more) are often discounted by banks partly on the strength
of collateral securities deposited to fortify the names upon
the notes.</p>

<p><i>f.</i> Bills of Exchange. A Bill of Exchange is a written
instrument designed to secure the payment of a distant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
debt without the transmission of money, being in effect a
setting-off or exchange of one debt against another. It
is in form and in several technicalities different from a
promissory note, inasmuch as it is an <i>order to pay</i> instead
of a <i>promise to pay</i>, and inasmuch as the maker of a note
is always <i>debtor</i> and the drawer of a bill of exchange is
always <i>creditor</i>; but all this makes practically very little
difference between the two as instruments of Credit, since
nearly all bills of exchange come into banks in the way of
ordinary business, either for discount or collection, and as
the banks care nothing except for <i>names</i>, the <i>form</i> of the
purchasable paper is a matter of indifference to them.
The following is the essential form of an inland bill of
exchange:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<span class="rspace">$3,000</span><span class="smcap lspace">Pittsfield</span>, Mass., Oct. 16, 1889.<br />
</p>

<p>Four months after date pay to the order of <span class="smcap">John Kent</span> three thousand
dollars, value received, and charge the same to account of</p>

<p>
To <span class="smcap">Eli Tripp</span>, Boston, <span class="rspace">Mass.</span>
<span class="smcap lspace">Dan Storrs.</span><br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>In the case of this bill, which may serve as a sample of
thousands, Storrs is the <i>drawer</i>, who is creditor in relation
to Tripp, and Tripp is <i>drawee</i>, but Storrs is debtor in relation
to Kent, who is the <i>payee</i>. A bill of exchange is the
sale of a debt, in such a way that two debts are so far
forth set off against each other, and both transactions are
closed without sending any money at all. Tripp owes
Storrs, and Storrs owes Kent, and so Storrs pays Kent by
an order on Tripp. As this is a bill at four months, Kent
will doubtless send it to Tripp for his <i>acceptance</i>, as it is
called, that is, his acknowledgment that he owes Storrs
to that amount, and that he will pay the sum to the holder
of the bill when it becomes due. An acceptance is written
on the <i>face</i> of a bill, and an indorsement upon the
<i>back</i> of the note: the initials are sufficient for the name of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
an acceptor, but the full business name is usual for an
indorser.</p>

<p>Thus a bill of exchange is the formal sale of a debt, in
order to liquidate thereby another debt, when the parties
to the transaction live in different and distant places.
Storrs does business in Pittsfield, and Tripp in Boston, and
it is a matter of comparative indifference where Kent lives,
unless there is trouble at the time of collection, for he will
perhaps negotiate this bill again, that is, make use of it to
pay some debt that he himself owes. It is not often that
the same person, as Tripp, happens to owe another person
in a distant town, as Storrs, the same amount as Storrs
owes another person somewhere, as Kent; but by two bills
of exchange, one drawn by each creditor on his own debtor,
and then each set off against the other, through the simple
and beautiful expedient of bank balances, substantially the
same advantages are reached as if it always happened so.
Many bills of exchange are drawn <i>at sight</i>, as it is called,
in which case the payee presents it for payment to the
drawee, there is no acceptance and no discount, and a bill
of this kind becomes the same as a cheque.</p>

<p>Time bills, however, are usually discounted: the payee
indorses his claim over to a fourth party by name, or, by
what is called an indorsement <i>in blank</i>, that is, by merely
writing his own name on the back of the bill, makes it
payable to bearer: when banks buy these bills for discount,
it is on the joint credit of acceptor and drawer and payee,
and in that order of validity and precedence: a promissory
note may be protested by a bank without notice to the
maker, but a bill of exchange cannot be without notice to
the drawer: a promissory note has two parties to it, a
debtor and a creditor; while a bill of exchange has three
parties to it, two creditors and a debtor.</p>

<p>Inland bills of exchange, both time bills and sight bills,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
are very convenient in settling debts between distant places
without the costly, and more or less hazardous, transmission
of money back and forth; besides this, time bills possess
the very useful function of enabling a debt due from
one person to avail the creditor as a means of obtaining
credit from a third party in discount; and in addition to
these two points of benefit, it is plain, that the common
use of bills of exchange in all their forms releases from
use large amounts of money that would else be needful in
trade. The less money in use in any country beyond a
certain point, the better, because, if coin, it costs much to
mint and maintain it, and if paper, it is difficult to make
and sustain it of full value.</p>

<p>Bankers sometimes change what they call "exchange"
for settling debts between distant places in the same country;
in some cases there may be a sound reason for this,
in other cases there is none, but in all cases it adds a little
to the profits of the banks for handling the bills of exchange;
the principle of charging an "exchange" is this,&mdash;when
one place as Chicago draws more bills on another place as
New York than suffice to cancel the bills drawn at that
time by New York on Chicago, the point <i>at</i> which the
larger indebtedness lies is the point for sending drafts <i>to</i>
which banks naturally charge a percentage; perhaps the
idea, which is actually realized in foreign exchange, that
money may have to be sent to liquidate such a balance,
may have brought in the custom of charging "exchange"
in such cases; and there are instances aside from such a
supposed balance, in which there may be an extra cost of
collection in some form to the bank, that may justify an
"exchange" charge; but there is another principle counterworking
and often neutralizing entirely this alleged
doctrine of a "balance" of debt as between two distant
places, namely, that the chief settling place and commercial
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
centre of a country, such as New York is, draws towards
itself from the whole circuit with such force, everybody
wanting a balance there and having occasion to send funds
thither, that drafts on such a place are apt to bear a premium
without any reference to its comparative indebtedness
at the time.</p>

<p>Very similar to these inland bills in their nature and
course and usefulness are Foreign Bills of Exchange,
which, as a vastly important topic, especially in its relations
with Foreign Trade, we must now study minutely
and completely. Commercial relations between two countries,
let us say, for instance, France and England, always
give rise to a mutual indebtedness of their merchants; if
these reciprocal debts were all to be paid by the actual
sending of money to and from, there would have to be a
constant and expensive and more or less hazardous outward
and inward flow of the precious metals in respect to
each country; all which necessity is neatly obviated by
the use of reciprocal bills of exchange, and coin is only
transmitted to settle the balances on whichever side there
may happen an excess of debt at the time. French dealers
are always sending goods to England, and English dealers
goods to France; and for what they send to England the
French merchants draw bills of exchange on the parties to
whom the goods are consigned, and the English merchants
draw similar bills on their debtors in France; then these
bills are bought up by bankers or brokers in either country,
and virtually exposed again for sale through new bills
drawn against them to any parties who may have debts to
pay in the other country. Thus bills on London, in other
words, on English debtors, are always for sale in France;
and bills on France, that is, on French debtors, are always
for sale in London; the reciprocal debtors of the two
countries, therefore, instead of sending coin to cancel their
debts, buy and transmit these bills.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span></p>

<p>Let us take a sample instance. Pierre &amp; Co. of Paris
send a cargo of wine worth £1000 in English money to
John Barclay of London. Barclay thus becomes indebted
to the Paris firm to that amount, and Pierre &amp; Co. draw
at once, so soon as the cargo is despatched, a bill in
francs to the equivalent of £1000. If they themselves
have no debt to pay in London, they will sell this bill
immediately to a Paris banker or broker (if the exchange
be then at par) for its full face <i>minus</i> interest for the time
it has to run, say two months; this broker is now ready to
sell this bill again, or what is the same, his own bill drawn
on the strength of it, to anybody in Paris who may have a
debt to pay in London; and the party in London who
receives it in liquidation of a French debt to him, presents
it at maturity to John Barclay for payment. Thus one
bill of exchange serves the ends of two creditors and one
debtor: Pierre &amp; Co. get their pay for the wine, the London
party gets his pay for goods, and Barclay pays his
debt, by means of it. A bill drawn in London for a cargo
of hardware sent to Paris is similarly negotiated with a
London broker or banker, and finds its way similarly to
France in payment of some English debt owed there, and
ends its course when it reaches the French firm on which
it was originally drawn.</p>

<p>We are now in position to understand clearly what is
meant by the <i>par of Exchange</i> in its commercial (not coinage)
import. The merchants in Paris, who have debts
due to them from London, draw bills of exchange for the
amount of these debts; and, through the agency of middlemen,
go into the market to sell these bills to other Paris
dealers who have debts to pay in London. If the former
class have a larger amount to sell than the latter have
occasion to buy, in other words, if there be a larger amount
of debts due from London to Paris than from Paris to London,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
then the natural competition of the sellers in Paris of
the bills on London will lower their price somewhat in
that market (Paris), in order, as usual, that the Supply
and Demand may be equalized there. In this case the par
of exchange is disturbed, a bill on London for £100 in
francs may not sell for over £99, and the exchange is then
said to be 1% <i>against</i> London, or, which is the same thing,
1% <i>in favor</i> of Paris.</p>

<p>The <i>par of Exchange</i>, accordingly, between two countries,
depends on the substantial equality of their commercial
debts. In the above example, if the exchange as
against London in favor of Paris continue long, and especially
if the premium of 1% on bills drawn in London on
Paris be sufficient to cover the expense of the transmission
of specie from London to Paris, gold will begin to flow
from London to Paris, because the debtors there may find
it cheaper for themselves to buy and send gold than to pay
the high premium on bills; and thus the equilibrium of
payments and the commercial par may be restored. Also,
this par tends to restore itself, without any sending of
specie, in this other perfectly natural and effectual way:
if bills on Paris are at a premium in London, for the same
reason that they are so will bills on London be at a discount
in Paris; therefore, there will be a direct encouragement
to the extent of the premium for <i>exportation</i> of goods
from England to France, because on every cargo thus sent
bills can be drawn and sold in London for a premium;
while the more bills on Paris thus offered in London, the
more the premium disappears of course, and the par will
be restored so soon as the bills on Paris substantially equal
the bills on London offered in Paris; and at the same time,
so long as the discount on London bills continues in Paris,
there is a direct <i>discouragement</i> to further exportations
from France to England, because the bills drawn in virtue
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
of such cargoes can only be sold below par, and this too
tends to <i>restore</i> the par in the commercial sense of the
term.</p>

<p>Here is another instance of a magnificently comprehensive
law, by which Nature vindicates her right to reign in
the domain of Exchange. It is through this natural and
beneficent law of automatic compensations, stimulating
exportations on the one side and slackening them on the
other, that most of the casual disturbances of the commercial
par as between two countries are easily and perfectly
rectified.</p>

<p>While this great law is in full possession of our minds,
let us note in passing how artificial restrictions by one
country on the importation of goods from another, commonly
called "Protectionism," affects this commercial par
as between those two countries. Besides stopping absolutely
a mass of otherwise profitable exportations and importations
for both countries, it makes less profitable to
the country imposing the restrictions whatever foreign
trade <i>does take place</i> between them in spite of the restrictions.
Suppose England, as is the fact, opens her ports
freely to the commodities of France, while France puts
restrictions in the shape of heavy taxes upon importations
from England; more French goods are likely under these
circumstances to seek English ports than English goods to
seek French ports, because they are more welcome; consequently,
more bills of exchange drawn on London will
naturally be offered in Paris than bills on Paris in London,
and will so far forth be sold at a discount, while the
London bills drawn on Paris will be sold at a premium;
in other words, the comparatively few goods that do get
out of a "protected" country, realize less to their owners
than the natural value, because the bills drawn on them
are extremely apt to be sold below par! With this course
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
of things all known facts agree. Since the United States
became conspicuously a "protected" country a quarter of
a century ago, it has been at rare intervals and for short
periods that bills drawn here on London have been at par.
They have been usually much below par. The equivalent
of £1 sterling in United States money is $4.8665; and
when bills on London sell for less per pound sterling than
$4.86, they are at a discount in New York or Boston; and
exporters here are direct losers to the extent of the discount.</p>

<p>If, however, notwithstanding the beautiful action of
this great law of commerce, the disturbance in the commercial
par as between two countries continues obstinate,
it indicates one of several things as true of the country,
whose bills of exchange drawn on another persist in a
considerable discount; (1) it has come to be a pretty
steady debtor country as towards the other, by sending
thither its national or State or corporation bonds, whose
interest and ultimately principal also must sooner or later
be remitted in exports <i>extra</i> to the exports needed to pay
for the current imports of goods; (2) it has either naturally
or by persistence in a bad public policy little or no
shipping of its own, so that freights both ways have to be
paid to foreigners in the form of exported goods <i>extra</i> to
those exported to pay for those imported in transient
trade, which of course increases the number and face of
the bills drawn <i>in</i> the luckless country <i>on</i> the lucky
country or countries; (3) it has made the vast and fatal
mistake of excluding by legal barriers of taxes put on for
that purpose the goods of foreigners, whose only motive
in coming is to take off corresponding goods of the deluded
country's own to the profit of both, and so these
last-mentioned goods must seek a foreign market (if at
all) at reduced rates, their natural market having been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
destroyed by national law; and (4) it may have made the
national money in which the bills drawn on it are liable
to be paid an inferior money, either transiently by mere
abundance or permanently by worsened quality, which is
well illustrated in the instance of Amsterdam as cited in
a preceding chapter, and which can only be remedied by
raising the standard of the money to the level of the
best.</p>

<p>Very little, if anything, can be inferred as to the prosperity
of a country or even as to the real condition of its
"exchanges" in this technical sense of the term, by the
transient movements of gold to and from the commercial
countries, in their present complex relations as gold-producing
and non-gold-producing countries and as debt-settling
and non-debt-settling centres. Gold moves back
and forth in obedience to several other impulses than to
settle the balances in an international trade of Commodities.
Gold-producing countries of course export gold just
as they would any other native product. If for any reason
gold becomes relatively more abundant in one country
than in other commercial countries around it, general
prices will rise in that country in consequence; which
means, that gold is then and there the cheapest article
that the people of that country can export to pay their
commercial debts with. Also, the imports which a nation
pays for in gold, or in bills of exchange bought
above par, are often bought with a high profit. Creditor
nations, nations that have managed to make themselves
settling-places for the world's commercial debts, and nations
that welcome imports without impediment from every
quarter of the earth (and England may serve as a sample
for all these three), will largely pay for imports in gold
or in bills bearing a premium.</p>

<p>It is a thousand pities, that technical terms which are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
quite misleading unless one remembers their origin and
exact significance, have come to be intrenched in commercial
language too strongly to be dislodged at this late
day, as the common terms to express the state of the
"exchanges" as between two countries. These terms are
"<i>against</i>" and "<i>in favor of</i>." The old Mercantile system,
which has left other unsavory progeny behind it besides
this, in order to keep and heap gold and silver in a country,
encouraged exports in every way and discouraged imports,
in order that the "<i>balance of trade</i>," as the phrase ran,
that is, the difference in volume between exports and imports,
might come back to the country in gold and silver;
and this foolish and now thoroughly exploded notion gave
rise to the terms in question; exchanges were then said
to be "against" a country when the record seemed to
show more imports than exports, as if that implied that
the imports were too great for a "balance" in gold and
silver; and were said to be "in favor of" a country when
its export-line was greater than the line of imports, as
implying a favorable balance to be met by a specie-import
in future. The false "System" is gone forever, but
the "terms" still abide in commercial language, and confuse
the minds more or less (more rather than less) of
everybody who tries to make these terms a vehicle of
thought. We have now described the causes and courses
of international bills of exchange without resorting to
these technicalities, which imply movements of gold and
silver which do not actually take place under the conditions
supposed; for example, the exchanges were "in
favor" of the United States in 1874-77, there being an
apparent trade balance of $164,000,000 in 1877 and a still
larger in 1876 and a larger one in the two years preceding,
but the import of specie was small in all those
years, averaging about $25,000,000 a year, and the rest of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
the excess of exports went to pay interest due to foreigners,
freights on the cargoes both ways, and so on. It
is difficult to use without abusing the terms "against"
and "in favor of" in this connection, and the reader is
cautioned not to employ them; although "discount" and
"premium" on international bills of exchange are matters
extremely important to observe and to know the grounds
of. Were there no counterworking principle, bills of
exchange drawn <i>on</i> capitalist and creditor countries, like
Great Britain, whose imports are apt to be strongly in excess
of the exports, and whose public policy is wise enough
to put no obstacles in the way of the free receipt of imports,
would be at a <i>discount</i> in countries sending exports
thither.</p>

<p>This counterworking principle, already illustrated as to
inland exchange in the case of New York, is best seen
internationally in connection with London, which is the
settling-place of the world's commerce. When the Romans
dredged the Thames and made "the pool" just below
London Bridge, they took the first steps towards making
that town a commercial centre; since a market for products
is products in market, the busy exchange of commodities
there has quickened in every age the accumulation of
capital and the increase of population; previous to the
Dock Laborers' Strike in 1889, about 100 vessels entered
the port of London every day, which received about one-half
of the total customs revenue of the United Kingdom,
and sent out about one-fourth of its exports; the business
of out-of-the-way and semi-civilized countries has somehow
(and it would not be hard to tell why) centered in
London, as well as the business of originally British
Colonies everywhere and of all other commercial countries;
accordingly, debtors and creditors abound there, bills
of exchange concentre there, and debts due from everywhere
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
are payable <i>there</i>; and therefore, because bills on
London are good all over the world, the Demand for them
counterworks the natural cheapness of the bills drawn on
exports <i>thither</i> as compared with the natural dearness of
the bills drawn there on exports <i>thence</i>.</p>

<p>Another thing must be borne in mind in comparing the
merchandise accounts of any country, namely, that whenever
the "exchange" is sufficient to cover the cost and
risk of the transmission of gold, gold itself is likely to go
freely from the country, in which bills drawn on exports
are at a premium, or to use for once the old hazardous
phrase, "<i>against</i>" which the exchanges have turned, and
bills will be drawn on that gold, as upon common merchandise,
and sold of course for the sake of the premium;
or, if a decidedly higher rate of discount prevail in a
neighboring country, gold will naturally go thither from
the lower-rate lands, because lenders in the latter will
desire to realize the higher rate of current interest on
money, and bills will be drawn on this gold as well, which
will tend to lower the premium on bills there; unless,
then, the premium <i>and</i> the difference in interest abroad
will justify the speculation, the gold will not stir; although,
if the difference in interest abroad were very considerable
and promised to continue for some time, the bills on the
gold might sell at a discount and still leave a profit to the
senders; but the home bankers can always stop a drain of
gold of this kind by raising their own rates of discount.</p>

<p>This casual mention of bankers leads on to the weighty
point, that the whole business of foreign exchange is
falling more and more into the hands of the bankers,
because bills drawn <i>by</i> and <i>upon</i> well-known bankers
naturally have a better credit than ordinary commercial
bills, the names upon which are less widely and favorably
known. Accordingly, persons sending cargoes of cotton,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
say, or of any other valuables, from New York to Liverpool,
arrange with their bankers in New York to have the
proceeds of the cargoes put to the <i>bankers'</i> credit in London,
and then these bankers draw bills on the London
bankers, which will bring a higher price in New York than
a common commercial bill, because many remitters and
most travellers prefer bankers' bills, which, though they
cost more, pay better and buy better abroad. Commercial
bills are still bought and sold in every commercial town,
but bankers' bills are more and more taking their place;
and the quotations usually give the current price of each.</p>

<p>London is so prominent as the settling-place of the
world's transactions by means of bills drawn on and by
London bankers, partly on account of the commercial predominance
of England, partly from excellent banking customs
there, and mainly because an immense mass of cheap
loanable capital exists there, which even foreigners may
borrow at London rates, provided only that they can get
credit there, that is, leave to draw on a London banker, to
whom of course remittances must be made as fast as he
accepts their bills. Besides, the Bank of England, as the
principal bank in Great Britain, and as closely connected
with the Government, acts as a bank of support to the
public and private Credit of that country. It does a regular
business as a bank of deposits and discounts, but it
means to keep its rate of discount somewhat above the
rate demanded by the other bankers in London, so as not
to come into competition with them much in their ordinary
business, and be able to act as a bank of support to
them and all others in times of pressure. All banks have
about so much credit to sell, <i>and no more</i>; most banks sell
in ordinary times about all the credit they have, because
their profits depend on that; but if the Bank of England
did this, it would become useless in periods of panic. In
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
point of fact, that Bank just begins to sell its reserve
credit, when the credit of the bankers below is exhausted.
When they are at the <i>end</i> of their rope, there is generally an
abundance of slack rope still in the great Institution above.</p>

<p>Now, as gold can be drawn out of the Bank of England
by the cheques of depositors as well as by the presentation
of its own notes for redemption, the Rate of Discount becomes
a matter of prime importance in the management of
the Bank. The whole line of deposits is a line of liabilities to
pay out gold, if the depositors demand it; and, as deposits
come largely through discounts, whenever there is a strong
tendency to draw out gold so as to weaken the reserves
of the Bank, the directors have an effectual remedy by
raising the rate of discount. The higher the <i>price</i> the
Bank charges for its credit, the fewer, so far forth, will be
its customers, and the smaller its line of deposits, and the
less likely a continuous drain of gold from its vaults.
The Bank of England is managed throughout by so simple
a manner as the turning back and forth of this magic screw
of Discount.</p>

<p>Besides the use of the term "Par of Exchange" in the
broad commercial sense in which we have now been examining
it, as indicating the substantial equality of international
debts as between two countries by the current
prices of bills of exchange, there is another and subordinate
sense in which the phrase is employed, namely, as denoting
the <i>relative value</i> of the coins of one nation in the coins of
another. Thus, our present gold dollar contains 23.22
grains of pure gold; the English pound sterling contains
113.001 grains; consequently, there are $4.8665 to the
English pound; and this is the "par of exchange" (in the
secondary sense) between the United States and Great
Britain. Between the United States and France the "par"
is $1 to 5.18 francs, since the franc is 19.29 of our cents.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
An English shilling equals 24.33 of our cents, the new
German "mark" is 23.82 cents, and the new Scandinavian
"crown" equals 26.78 cents.</p>

<p><i>g.</i> Bank Cheques. In substance indeed and even in
form, Cheques are Bills of Exchange, but the two have
such differing legal incidents, and run so different a course
towards extinguishment, that for our purposes in this treatise
they should be put under a separate discussion. Bills
of exchange are expressly drawn "at sight" or for a day
certain, when they become payable by the drawee: cheques
<i>say</i> nothing about "sight" or any future date, though
they are <i>really</i> drawn at sight, and are payable to bearer
on demand: they must, therefore, be presented for payment
within the shortest reasonable time (all things considered),
in order that the holder may legally claim against
the drawer should the banker fail meantime: a cheque is
held as the payment of a debt until it be dishonored on
presentation: the banker bears the risk of the forgery of
the drawer's name, unless his mistake be made easier by
the drawer's carelessness in drawing: a cheque is not
payable after the drawer's death. The parties to cheques
are the Drawer, who is a depositor with some banker; that
banker thus becomes the Drawee; and the person named in
the cheque is the Payee, who can indorse his own right over
to another person by name or in blank to bearer. When a
cheque is drawn in this way by one <i>banker</i> upon another,
it is usually called in this country a <i>Draft</i>.</p>

<p>Formerly in England, and in other countries as well,
each considerable dealer kept his own strong box, and
when he had occasion to make payments, told down the
solid cash upon his own counter. Afterwards, the goldsmiths
of London solicited the honor of keeping in their
vaults the spare cash of the merchants, and these in their
payments among each other came to employ orders or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
cheques drawn on the goldsmiths, and at the shops of the
latter the principal payments in coin were effected. The
later introduction of Banks brought along with it the custom,
now continually widening in commercial countries
among all classes of the people, of keeping one's funds
with some banker, and making payments by written orders
or cheques upon him. When the person making the payment
and the person receiving it keep their money with
the same banker, there is no need of any money at all
passing in the premises, the sum being merely transferred
in the banker's books from the credit of the payer to the
credit of the receiver. The banker is quite willing usually
to do this business for nothing, and even sometimes to
allow the depositors a low rate of interest on all balances
remaining in his hands, in consideration of the privilege
involved of loaning such proportion of the aggregate of
these sums as he deems safe to other parties at a higher
rate of interest.</p>

<p>In the larger cities, by an arrangement called the
"Clearing-house," substantially the same benefits are
secured as if all the depositors of the city kept their cash
at the same bank; inasmuch as all the cheques drawn on
each of the different banks, and passing in the course of
the business day into other banks, are assorted before evening
at all the banks, and adjusted the next morning
through the clearing-house, and the credits and debits of
each bank are set off as far as possible against each other,
leaving only small balances to be settled in money.</p>

<p>The London Bankers' Clearing-house was established
in 1775; in 1864, the Bank of England was admitted to
it; and since then, the Clearing-house itself, and all the
bankers and firms using it, keep accounts with the Bank
of England, and the balances, formerly settled by money,
are now adjusted by simple transfers of account on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
books of that great Bank. This carries out the grand principle
of the Clearing further than it has yet been carried
in this Country, although the United States Sub-Treasury
not very long ago joined the New York Clearing-house,
while the practical details of the Clearing are simpler and
better in New York than in London. The average clearings
in the London house (and there are besides many
other clearing-houses in the United Kingdom) were £5,218,000,000
a year for 1875-80, and the amounts cleared frequently
rose to £20,000,000 a day; which, if paid in gold
coin, would weigh about 157 tons and require about 80
horses to carry it; and if paid in silver coin would weigh
more than 2500 tons and require 1275 horses. This is
stated on the excellent authority of the late Professor
Jevons.</p>

<p>The total business of the 23 clearing-houses of the United
States in 1880 was over $50,000,000,000; the New York
Clearing-house did 65% of that business for that year; and
the average daily clearings there for the fiscal year 1879
were $76,167,983.</p>

<p>We will now describe mainly from personal observation
the New York Clearing-house, which was established in
1853, premising that the principle is the same, though the
details may be different, in all other clearing-houses wherever
located. Business men in New York, as elsewhere,
usually pass in to their bankers as a deposit all the cheques
and current credits received in the course of a business
day. It is the custom for everybody to draw his own
cheque <i>on</i> his banker to make payments with, and to pass
in <i>to</i> his banker the cheques he receives from others. Say
there are sixty clearing-banks in New York City. Each of
these banks sorts out after business hours every day all
the cheques it has received that day drawn on each of the
other banks into separate parcels ready for the clearing the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
next morning. Each bank has, then, fifty-nine parcels <i>to
deliver</i>, which represent the property of that bank, and are
a <i>claim</i> upon the other banks; and also <i>to receive</i> fifty-nine
parcels, which represent the property of the other banks,
and are a claim upon <i>itself</i>.</p>

<p>Before ten o'clock in the morning sixty messengers, each
having fifty-nine parcels to deliver, appear at the clearing-house,
each reporting to the manager at once for record the
amount of "exchange" he has brought, which is entered
of course as <i>credit</i> to his bank; and then all take their positions
in order in front of the sixty desks, which occupy
the floor of the house, behind which sit sixty clerks, each
representing one of the banks. Each messenger stands
opposite the desk of his own bank, with his fifty-nine parcels
already arranged in the exact order of the bank-desks
before him. Of course no messenger has anything to
deliver to the clerk of his own bank. Each clerk inside
his desk has a sheet of paper containing the names of all
the other banks arranged in the same order as the desks,
with the amounts carried out upon it which his messenger
has just brought to each. All these are entered in his
credit column. Each messenger carries also a slip of paper
ready to be delivered with each parcel to each clerk, on
which is entered the amount of the cheques he now brings
to each bank. Of course the amount delivered <i>to</i> each bank
is <i>debit</i> to that bank, just as the amount brought <i>by</i> each
is <i>credit</i> to that bank.</p>

<p>A signal from the manager, who stands on a raised platform
at one end of the room with his two or more clerks
before him, and each messenger steps forward to the next
desk in front of him, delivers his parcel and also the slip
that goes with it, which latter the clerk signs with his
initials and hands back to the messenger as his voucher
for the delivery; and then each messenger advances to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
next desk,&mdash;the whole <i>cue</i> moving in order,&mdash;at which
precisely the same things take place as before, and so on,
until the circuit of the room is made, and each comes
opposite again the desk of his own bank, having passed to
each its "exchange" and taken a receipt for each delivery.
This process takes about ten minutes; when each clerk,
who had on his sheet to start with the <i>credit</i> due to his
bank, has now the <i>data</i> (fifty-nine items) by which to calculate
the <i>debit</i> of his bank. The difference between the
aggregate of cheques <i>received</i> and <i>brought</i> by his bank is
the balance due <i>to</i> or <i>from</i> the clearing-house as to that
bank.</p>

<p>All the clerks report to the manager the amounts <i>received</i>
by each, and as his proof-sheets hold already the amounts
<i>brought</i>, if the two columns add up alike, no mistake has
been made, and the general clearing is over. Thirty-five
minutes are allowed the clerks to enter, report, and prove
their work. Fines are imposed for errors discovered after
that time. The Clearing-house gives tickets of debit or
credit to all the banks, and the debit ones must pay in
lawful money before half-past one, and the credit ones will
get their due from the manager immediately after. The
largest sum ever cleared in New York in one day was
$206,034,920.51 on Nov. 17, 1868, and the smallest $8,357,394.82
on Oct. 30 of the panic year, 1857.</p>

<p><i>h.</i> Crossed Cheques. About twenty years ago there
was instituted in London what is called the Cheque-Bank,
which is designed to bring the benefits of the credit-system
in the form of cheques more easily to all classes of the
people. The cheques issued by this institution are so different
in character and in course from common bank-cheques,
and are in some respects so new in principle, that we must
give to them a separate heading and a full explanation.</p>

<p>The Cheque-Bank is a stock company in London under
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
that style, which has entered into relations with nearly all
the banks and bankers of the United Kingdom, and with
many Colonial and foreign banks also, by which Cheque-Books
are furnished for sale by the Cheque-Bank through
these associated banks, which also agree to cash the
cheques, every cheque in which books indicates by printed
and indelible perforated notices upon the forms what the
utmost sum is against which that cheque can be drawn;
the aggregate of these perforated sums is the price for
which each book is sold less 1<sup><big>1</big></sup>&frasl;<sub><big>5</big></sub> penny for each cheque in
it, of which the penny is for the Government stamp required
and the one-fifth for the profits of the Cheque-Bank;
and all these cheques in books of different sizes and
amounts are drawn in form <i>on</i> the Cheque-Bank, and
<i>Crossed</i>, that is, <i>only made payable through a banker</i>. It is
one security against fraud that each cheque bears on its
face the utmost sum for which it can be used, and another
is that it can only be taken up by a banker and thus settled
ultimately through the clearing-house. The Crossed
Cheques Act of Parliament in 1876 makes any obliteration
of the crossing or essential alteration of a cheque <i>felony</i>
at law.</p>

<p>Cheque-crossing is of two kinds, <i>special</i> and <i>general</i>;
when any particular banker's name is written between two
transverse lines, in which form alone crossed cheques differ
from ordinary ones, that makes that cheque payable by
him only; when the words "<i>and Company</i>" or "<i>and Co.</i>"
are written between these lines, that makes the cheque
payable only through <i>some</i> banker, that is, the cheque is
crossed <i>generally</i>; and when two parallel transverse lines
simply are drawn across the face of a cheque, with or
without the words "not negotiable," that cheque is legally
deemed to be <i>crossed</i> and crossed <i>generally</i>. When a
cheque is uncrossed, the lawful holder may cross it either
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
generally or specially; when it is crossed generally, he
may at his option cross it specially; and whether crossed
generally or specially he may add the words "not negotiable."
All this facilitates greatly the <i>collection</i> of cheques
by set-off through the clearing; and has a direct bearing
on the fortunes of the Cheque-Bank.</p>

<p>The Cheque-Bank publicly guarantees the payment of
all the cheques in all its cheque-books to the maximum
amount for which each cheque may be drawn; and it may
well do this, for no cheque-book is sold except for money,
and the money is ready in the hands of some banker to
pay every cheque when presented; any banker or other
person will give cash for them, or take them in payment
for goods or other services, or if they are drawn for a sum
larger than the debt due will give back the charge to the
bearer; and if the cheques be actually drawn for less than
the maximum perforated on them, the Bank itself will
give additional cheques for the balance. The ultimate
payment, then, of these cheques is as sure as anything in
the future can be; the buyer of a cheque-book knows, that
the money is already in deposit to pay them, and that the
government-stamps on them have already been paid for,
while the receiver of an ordinary cheque cannot know
beforehand that the drawer has money in deposit against
it. Moreover, the holder of an ordinary cheque must use
due diligence in presenting it for payment as soon as
possible, or delay it at his own risk, while the holder of
these has no motive whatever for haste,&mdash;time does not
deteriorate them. All money received for cheque-books
is left in the hands of the bankers who sell them, or transferred
to other bankers in order to meet the cheques presented
elsewhere, and accordingly an interest is paid by
the bankers to the Cheque-Bank, on the balance of deposits
thus held, and this interest, together with the one-fifth of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
penny for each cheque, is the only source of profit to the
Cheque-Bank. Of course, the longer these cheques
remain out before presentation, the more profitable to the
Cheque-Bank; and their average length of life has been
heretofore not far from ten days.</p>

<p>Since these cheques are crossed <i>generally</i> (not specially)
with the words "and Co.," that is to say, since they can
ultimately be taken up only by some banker, they have a
more <i>generalized</i> character than common bank-cheques,
they are safer to carry and keep than so much money
would be, there is no difficulty in shopping or paying
wages by means of them, they are very much the same in
their nature as bank bills are, and might easily in certain
circumstances become <i>money</i> just as bank bills in some
circumstances are money. Each of the associated banks
keeps an account of course with the Cheque-Bank, but is
not obliged to keep a separate account with the purchasers
of cheque-books, which is a great relief to the banks. In
this way the Cheque-Bank extends the use of cheques in
the lieu of money to a great multitude of small transactions,
and relieves the other banks from what would
otherwise be a great deal of troublesome accounting and
collection. The ingenuity and the utility of this comparatively
new form of Credit cannot be questioned for one
moment; the promoters of the Bank intended that their
cheques should be received by the people as a substitute
for cash and for Post Office orders, and such has been the
effect, many railway and other companies having long ago
agreed to receive them as cash, and the people generally
regard them as cheaper and more convenient than postal
orders and even for many purposes than cash.</p>

<p><i>i.</i> Cash Credits. As the Cheque-Bank in the sense as
just explained has been thus far in the history of Credit
peculiar to England, so we have now to look to Scotland
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
only for an exemplification of a form of Credit hitherto
confined to that country. It is a national characteristic of
the Scotch to be "canny," that is, they <i>can</i>, a word from
the old Teutonic <i>können, to be able</i>; and, as a consequence,
Scotch Banking has long been famous the world over; and
the one peculiarity of it, with which we are now concerned,
goes back certainly to 1729, as we happen to know from a
minute of the Directors of the Bank of Scotland under
that date. That bank was chartered by the old Scotch
Parliament in 1695, one year after the chartering by the
English Parliament of the Bank of England, and under
substantially the same title as that, namely, "The Governor
and Company of the Bank of Scotland." It began to
establish branches in different towns of the realm in 1696,
and began to issue bank notes for £1 (a privilege denied
to the Bank of England) in 1704; and it began also at a
very early period to exhibit the two main peculiarities of
Scotch banking, namely, (1) to receive deposits <i>on interest</i>
and (2) <i>to grant credit on cash accounts</i>, or, as they have
come to be called less properly, Cash Credits.</p>

<p>This second peculiarity, which has proved extremely
beneficial to Scotland, is for substance this, to create a
drawing account in favor of a deserving customer, who has
made as yet no deposits in the bank, but who draws out
money and pays it in from time to time just like an ordinary
depositor, and instead of receiving interest on the daily
balance to his <i>credit</i> (old Scotch fashion), he pays interest
on the daily balance to his <i>debit</i>. These accounts are called
Cash Credits. They are not intended to be dead loans, but
quick accounts; and they are not granted except to persons
in business, or to those who are frequently drawing out
and paying in money. The individual who has obtained
such a credit is enabled to draw the whole sum, or any
part of it, when he pleases, replacing it, or portions of it,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
when he pleases, according as he finds it convenient, interest
being charged only upon such part as he draws out.</p>

<p>David Hume in his Essay of the Balance of Trade,
published in 1752, makes this nice point in favor of Cash
Credits: "If a man borrows £5000 from a private hand,
besides that it is not always to be found when required, he
pays interest for it whether he be using it or not. On the
other hand, his Cash Credit costs him nothing, except
during the moment it is of service to him; and this circumstance
is of equal advantage as if he had borrowed money
at a much lower rate of interest." The Cash Credit is
always for a limited sum, seldom under £100, given upon
the customer's own security, and that in addition of two
or three individuals approved by the bank, who become
sureties for its payment. Of course, only those banks can
furnish such credits which possess a surplus of credit more
than they can sell in the ordinary way, and these credits
are safe and useful only in small communities, in which
men are well known to each other. Some friends of
the parties thus accommodated always guarantee the bank
against loss; but the losses have proved to be insignificant,
the gains to be marvellous; and this form of credit issued
on the basis of no previous transaction in the way of
deposits illustrates better than any other the radical principle,
that Credit is Capital.</p>

<p>The Report of a Committee of the House of Lords made
in 1826 on Scotch and Irish banking describes very clearly
and fully the system of Cash Credits: "There is also one
part of their system, which is stated by all the witnesses to
have had the best effects upon the people of Scotland, and
particularly upon the middling and poorer classes of society,
in producing and encouraging habits of frugality and
industry. The practice referred to is that of Cash Credits.
Any person who applies to a bank for a Cash Credit is called
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
upon to produce two or more competent sureties, who are
jointly bound; and after a full inquiry into the character
of the applicant, the nature of his business, and the sufficiency
of his securities, he is allowed to open a credit, and
to draw upon the bank for the whole of its amount, or for
such part of it as his daily transactions may require. To
the credit of the account he pays in such sums as he may
not have occasion to use, and interest is charged or credited
upon the daily balance, as the case may be. From
the facility which these Cash Credits give to all the small
transactions of the country, and from the opportunities
which they afford to persons who begin business with little
or no capital but their character to employ profitably the
minutest products of their industry, it cannot be doubted
that the most important advantages are derived to the
whole community. The advantage to the banks that give
these Cash Credits arises from the call which they continually
produce for the issue of their paper, and from the
opportunity which they afford for the profitable employment
of part of their deposits. The banks are indeed so
sensible that, in order to make this part of their business
advantageous and secure, it is necessary that their Cash
Credits should be operated upon, that they refuse to continue
them unless this implied condition be fulfilled. The
total amount of their Cash Credits is stated by one witness
to be £5,000,000, of which the average amount advanced
by the banks may be one-third."</p>

<p>There are only ten Banks doing business in Scotland,
and the Bank of Scotland, the oldest of these, had 86
branches in 1875, and the average number of branches of
the other nine is very nearly the same with that.</p>

<p><i>j.</i> Circular Credits. These are a device of bankers to
enable travellers and merchants of one country to obtain
credit and cash in foreign countries in sums to suit their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
convenience, not to exceed in the aggregate the limit
mentioned in the credits drawn. These credits assume
different forms and are called by different names, but they
are all at bottom foreign Bills of Exchange. They are
Orders to pay. They are drawn by Bankers at home upon
Bankers abroad. They are bought by travellers and
others, because they are safer to carry than so much money
would be, and much more convenient. In nearly all of
those forms the credits are available for no one else than the
payee, whose name is upon the form as well as the names
of the bankers who are the drawees, and so the credits are
not liable to be stolen, although they may be temporarily
(not ultimately) lost. Purchasers of such credits can
obtain money on them in all of the principal cities of the
world in just such sums as they need. They have ultimately
to pay for no more credit than they actually use,
because the drawer will pay back to the payee, in case he
has bought and paid for the entire credit drawn, the cash
difference; while on the other hand, arrangements can
always be made beforehand, by which money need not be
deposited with the banker at home any faster than it is
actually called for abroad; and while also a good customer
of the bank drawing the credit, one who keeps ordinarily a
good line of deposits, may pay for whatever credit he has
used when he returns from his trip.</p>

<p>There is one kind of these foreign credits that deserves
separate mention, since it has come of late years into quite
general use, namely, "Circular Notes," as they are called.
These are sight bills of exchange, each drawn for a relatively
small amount, say £10, and multiplied in number to
the requirements of the buyer, and drawn by one domestic
banking-house, say Kountze Brothers of New York, on one
foreign banking-house, say Union Bank of London, the
names of drawer and drawee only being upon the "notes,"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
the payee or buyer being expected to indorse each note in
the presence of the Correspondent making the payment.
The notes, therefore, are not negotiable except by the
signature of the payee himself from time to time as he
needs the proceeds. This makes them safer than so much
money to carry: if stolen, they could do the thief no
possible good. At the same time the drawer of the notes
furnishes the payee a circular letter addressed to his banking
correspondents all over the world, just as in an ordinary
Letter of Credit, containing the name and also the personal
signature of the payee, but unlike the ordinary Letter
making no reference to the amounts of credit furnished,
and there are no indorsements of any kind by the correspondents
on this circular letter, which the payee is
cautioned in print on the back <i>to keep separate</i> from the
Circular Notes covered by it. One of these letters runs as
follows, the name of the payee being entered in manuscript
and also in autograph:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="smcap">
<p>
"To our Correspondents,</p>
<p><span class="lspace2">Gentlemen</span>,<br />
</p>

<p><span class="lspace">This</span> letter will be presented to you by
Grace Perry, who is recommended to your kind attention,
and is supplied with our Circular Notes, the
value of which please furnish at the current rate for
sight bills on London, without any expense to us.
After you have examined this letter, please return it
to the bearer, in whose hands it will remain until the
expiration of the Circular Notes."</p></blockquote>

<p>These Circular Notes approximate in certain respects in
kind towards the cheques of the Cheque-Bank of London:
both are bought at the outset and paid for in full on the
spot; and both are drawn <i>upon one Bank</i>, which is the ultimate
Drawee and Payer. In two essential respects, however,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
the notes differ from the cheques: the cheques are
payable to Bearer without any indorsement by anybody,
and so have a much more <i>generalized</i> purchasing-power
than the notes, which have to be indorsed by the payee
(not named indeed in the notes but in the letter accompanying
them), as they are negotiated in a way preliminary to
their ultimate payment by the single bank on which they
are drawn; and also the notes, like all other foreign bills
of exchange, are subject in their value to the fluctuations
of International Exchange, while the cheques in their
value are independent of commercial exchanges "in favor"
or "against" any country, and entitle the bearer to so
many pounds sterling in value according to English coinage
without any possible discount or premium. These
London Cheques, accordingly, approach much nearer to
the character of Money than any other form of Credit yet
devised, except Bank bills undoubtedly convertible; and
already take their place as one of the <i>media</i> in the international
trade, and are sold in New York by authorized
agents of the Cheque-Bank, as they have long been by
such agents in all English and Colonial and in many foreign
cities.</p>

<p>These <i>Ten</i> are the principle instruments in Credit-Exchanges
throughout the world; and we pass now, as
proposed, to the next section of our subject, namely, the
Advantages of Credit.</p>

<p>3. As introducing these advantages and also as illustrating
them, we call attention first to the antiquity of many
of the forms of Credit, a point upon which much fresh
light has been cast by recent discoveries in, and ability to
decipher the cuneiform writing of, the ancient Assyria and
Babylonia. It is to the credit of Credit, that the earliest
of civilized men seem to have perceived its nature, to have
seized upon its powers, and to have realized for themselves
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
some of its advantages. Credit is natural and legitimate.
The moderns have invented new forms of it, and have
tested its capacities to the utmost, but the ancients know
it well in several of its instruments, and vindicate their
own insight into the recesses of Exchanges by tablets and
documents now known and read of all men.</p>

<p>In an earthenware jar found some years ago in the
neighborhood of Hillah, a few miles from Babylon, were
discovered many clay tablets inscribed with records relating
to banking, and, what is more, to banking as carried
on for generations by a single family or firm, which the
cuneiform archæologists have translated as "Egibi &amp; Co."
These tablets are now deposited in the British Museum.
Those who can read them say, that the founder of this
banking-house, Egibi, probably lived in the reign of Sennacherib,
about 700 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> This family has been traced in
banking transactions during a century and a half, and
through five generations down to the reign of Darius.
They were the Rothschilds in the region of the Euphrates:
they acted in a sort as the national bank of Babylon.</p>

<p>The Tigris is always associated with the Euphrates and
forever will be. Nineveh on the former river, like Babylon
on the latter, has yielded from its tablet-records information
as to the use of credit in the more northern capital
of Assyria. "Within the palace of Asshur-bani-pal, the
Sardanapalus of the Greeks, who reigned at Nineveh from
668 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>, Layard discovered what is known as the Royal
Library. There were two chambers, the floors of which
were heaped with books, like the Chaldean tablets already
described. The number of books in the collection has
been estimated at ten thousand. The writing upon some
of the tablets is so minute that it cannot be read without
the aid of a magnifying-glass. We learn from the inscriptions
that a librarian had charge of the collection. Catalogues
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
of the books have been found, made out on clay
tablets. The library was open to the public, for an inscription
of Asshur-bani-pal says, "<i>I wrote upon the tablets</i>; <i>I
place them in my palace for the instruction of my people.</i>"
The Assyrian tablets embrace a great variety of subjects;
the larger part, however, are lexicons and treatises on
grammar, and various other works intended as text-books
for scholars. Perhaps the most curious of the tablets yet
found are notes issued by the Government, and made redeemable
in gold and silver on presentation at the King's
treasury. Tablets of this character have been found bearing
date as early as 625 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> It would seem from this
that the Assyrians had very correct notions of the promise-character
of paper (tablet) money" (Myers).</p>

<p>In the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York are
Babylonian tablets bearing distinct records of credit transactions
that took place in the reign of Nebuchadnezzar.
The earliest tablet is of the year 601 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> On it are memoranda
of loans of silver made by Kurdurru as follows:
"1 mina of silver to Suta, 1 mina to Balludh, &#189; mina to
Buluepus, 5 shekels to Nabu-basa-napsate, and 5 shekels to
Nergal-dann;&mdash;total, 3 minas, 5 shekels of silver." There
are more than 50 similar tablets in this collection; the
latest dated, "Babylon, 18th day of 14th year of Darius,"
that is, <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 505. M. Lenormant, who can read them,
divides these credit documents into five principal types.
1. Simple obligations; 2. Obligations with a penal clause
in case of non-fulfilment; 3. Obligations with the guarantee
to a third party; 4. Obligations payable to a third
person; and 5. Drafts drawn upon one place, payable in
another. These last are letters of Credit. They contain
the names of several witnesses. They are evidently negotiable,
but from the nature of things could not pass by
indorsement, because when the clay was once baked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
nothing new could be added, and under these circumstances
the name of the payee was often omitted. It seems
to follow from this peculiarity, that the drawee must have
been regularly advised by the drawer. One of the credits
in this most interesting collection had 79 days to run.</p>

<p>The main elements of their civilization came to the
Greeks, and especially to the Greek cities in Asia Minor
demonstrably from the Eastward; the Greek West proved
itself quick to catch up the thoughts and the modes of the
East; accordingly, Isocrates in his plea against the banker,
Pasion, describes a formal bill of Exchange bought by
Stratocles in Athens, payable in Pontus, and guaranteed
principal and interest by Pasion; the practical Romans
were pupils of the Greeks in all such matters, and so
it came about in course of time, that Cicero wrote as follows
in a letter to Atticus,&mdash;"Let me know, if the money
my son needs at Athens can be sent him <i>by way of exchange</i>,
or if it be necessary for it to be taken to him,&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">permutarine
possit an ipsi ferendum sit</i>"; and after that the
Jews and the Lombards carried the Letter of Credit all
over the world.</p>

<p>It goes without saying, when the most civilized and
advanced people of the world were the first to adopt and
have been since the quickest to expand the use of Credit,
that there must be pretty obvious and very solid advantages
from such use and expansion; and we must now note
and weigh a few of these advantages.</p>

<p>(1) There are young men in every advanced community
in the world who have integrity and industry and skill,
but little or no <i>Capital</i>; and when such men are enabled
to borrow money, as by the Scotch system of "cash accounts"
or otherwise, to start themselves in business or to
enlarge a business already in successful operation, the general
interests of Production as well as their own personal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
interests, are greatly subserved by such credit; because
in all probability much capital thus passes out of hands
which are <i>less</i> into hands which are <i>more</i> able to use it <i>productively</i>.
Those who are best able to make capital <i>tell</i> by
increase are generally those who are most desirous to obtain
it, and frequently those who can offer the best security for
its replacement. Nothing, therefore, is to be said against,
but everything in favor of, such a loaning of capital as
shall bring it under safe conditions from the hands of the
idle and the aged, from those indisposed or incompetent
to use it productively, into other hands at once competent
and honest. Such credits as these are a benefit and only a
benefit to all the parties concerned, and to Society at large.
The active operators retain something of profit after replacing
the capital with current interest upon it; the lenders
receive more than if their capital remained idle, or they
employed it themselves; and Society is benefited by a more
complete development, and rapid circulation, of Services.
Despite all the instances of broken faith, it is still an honor
to human nature, that men do so gain by good character
the confidence of their fellows, that they are and ought to
be trusted with capital on their simple word or note; and
it is the glory of free political institutions, that under their
influence more than elsewhere, young men do rise by the
help of so slight a stepping-stone as this, in crowds, to the
high places of opulence.</p>

<p>In the important point of view, that thus all of the
available capital of a community is brought out into productive
activity, too much can scarcely be said of Savings-Banks,
which take the surplus earnings of the poor, and
not only keep them safely, but pay a fair interest on each
deposit, and loan the aggregate at a higher rate on choice
securities, thus stimulating frugality in a wide circle of
depositors, and at the same time aiding Production by opportune
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
loans to the best class of borrowers. In the year
1881, there were $443,000,000 invested in savings-banks
in the State of New York, and $230,000,000 in the small
State of Massachusetts.</p>

<p>In this first category of the advantages of Credit, come
also the ordinary bank discounts, made for short periods
only, holding the debtor to the strictest rules of payment,
only professing and only enabled to help customers over
the transient hard places in their business, and <i>not</i> to furnish
the funds on which the business is mainly conducted.
Loans drawn from the banks on interest should never be
put into the form of fixed capital, and should only be a
<i>part</i> of the quick or circulating capital, since only the
passing necessities of a business having an independent
basis and movement of its own, can safely be met by bank
discounts. The cash credits of Scotland are quite different
both in what they are and in what they imply from the
short and sharp discounts of the banks of our own country.</p>

<p>So far as the capital stock of banks is made up, as it
usually is, of a large number of comparatively small subscriptions,
there is the great advantage just spoken of, of
calling a multitude of otherwise idle sums into activity in
production; and so far as no undue privileges, unjust to
other corporations and individuals, are accorded to banks
by law, there is no branch of industry more legitimate and
beneficial than banking. It is no essential part of the
functions of a bank, that it manufacture and issue paper
money; that feature is always rather a source of weakness
than a ground of strength; the money the bank circulates
should always be the national money; and if that too, unfortunately,
should be credit-money, the element of credit
in the <i>money</i> should be sharply discriminated in the public
mind from that other and quite different element of credit
by which the bank <i>loans</i> it to its customers.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span></p>

<p>(2) There is another class of advantages in Credit,
which do not depend so much on the transfer of Capital
from less to more productive hands, as on the facilities
which credit affords in economizing the general operations
of Exchange. Here the advantages are derived from the
convenience of <i>settling accounts</i> arising out of exchanges,
rather than from the <i>character</i> of the exchanges themselves.
Look a moment, for example, at foreign Bills of Exchange.
They serve to settle up the accounts arising from the Commerce
of two or six Continents, with but little transmission
of money from any, and with but very little loss of time.
Commercial bills drawn in New York on London have been
usually payable at sixty days' sight; the New York merchant
despatching a ship is able to realize at once the value
of her cargo, minus interest for the time his bill has to
run; since bankers' bills have so largely taken the place
of "commercial" bills, the time is much shortened thereby,
and this is one reason why bankers' bills bear a higher
price in the market; the merchant or sender is indeed still
liable in part to see that his bill is ultimately paid by the
drawee; but the commercial integrity of the leading houses
and leading banks in all countries is with justice so firmly
believed in and acted on, that on the whole but little
anxiety springs from this source. It is one of the noble
things in international commerce, that men trust each
other across the oceans, and lay millions of value on the
faith of a single firm.</p>

<p>Inland bills of exchange equally facilitate settlements
within the country itself; and cheques, which are of the
same essential nature as inland bills, contribute to the same
end even more simply and surely, passing readily in payments
wherever the parties are known, and through credit
and set-off doing the work of money more conveniently
and economically than, and within certain limits just as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
safely as, money itself could do it. The face of a cheque
drawn to the amount of his deposit in favor of another
depositor in the same bank is transferred in the banker's
books from the credit of the drawer to that of the payee
by the stroke of a pen, no money at all passes in the
premises, while the banker is released from one debt by
creating another of equal amount, the drawer is released
from one debt by another to be transferred to the payee,
and the payee is paid by the drawer by the former's receipt
of another debt more acceptable to him.</p>

<p>(3) Besides the two essential functions of all banks,
namely, the receiving of deposits and the discounting of
bills, most of them perform a variety of other legitimate
operations in Credit, which must be classed among the
advantages of Credit. They buy and sell debts of all
sorts. They make collection of debts for their customers.
They sell their own drafts on distant places. Since 1863,
our national banks have done an immense business in
handling the debt of the United States: they were instrumental
in diffusing the national bonds among all classes of
the people: they collect for their customers the coupons at
maturity: they have been and still are the factors of the
government in exchanging, for those who desire it, one
species of bond for another; and the entire debt of the
United States has been several times changed, mainly
through the agency of the banks, from bonds at high rates
of interest and for short times of maturity to bonds at
lower rates and for longer times.</p>

<p>(4) The fourth, and probably the chief, advantage of
Credit is the fact, that a new purchasing-power is created
by means of it, a new Valuable, something additional to
all existing before in the world of Values. One can buy
other things with Credit, as well as with material Commodities
and personal Services. Credit, therefore, becomes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
a Salable under the two peculiar limitations already explained,
those of future Time and personal Confidence, just
as Commodities become a Salable under the peculiar limitations
belonging to <i>them</i>; and, what is more to the present
purpose, just as some Commodities (all of them salable)
become Capital under the action of the abstinence of their
owners, so some Credits (all of them salable) become Capital
under the action of the Abstinence of their owners.
Some commodities and some credits are expended, that is,
sold, for the immediate gratification of their owners, without
ever a thought of a future increase to accrue; but also,
some commodities and credits are reserved by their owners
for use in further production, that is, for future buying and
selling; and the motive in all such cases is the same that
creates all Capital everywhere, namely, the increase to
accrue as the result of such abstinence; and, consequently,
we lay down the postulate with all confidence, and enumerate
it as one of the main advantages of Credit, that
some Credits are <span class="smcap">Capital</span>, with all the powers in production
of that potent agent already exemplified.</p>

<p>It is only fair to apprise the reader right here, that
almost all Economists deny that any new capital is created
through Credit. These deny <i>in toto</i> that the relation of
debtor and creditor involves anything more than the exchange
between the two parties of certain <i>titles to tangible
goods</i>. Let the reader now hear, and then judge for himself.
Bonamy Price of Oxford University, a professed
Economist and a teacher of acknowledged ability, writes
as follows:<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
"<i>Omitting the capital which a joint stock company
puts into a bank, the banker possesses no capital, except
his premises and any coin that may be in them, however
much commercial and monetary literature may ascribe capital
to banks. Lines and names in ledgers, cheques at the</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
<i>Clearing-house, debts due to depositors, debts due upon bills
by borrowers, are neither wealth nor capital. They are words
and nothing more. Incorporeal property, under which these
kinds of written words are summed up, is not wealth; it is
merely a collection of title-deeds, but from which the reality
is absent. The corpus is not in those deeds, but the right to
acquire that property, even before possession is obtained, is
itself a property. If a title-deed or a mortgage is declared
to be actual wealth by Political Economy, then the sooner it
is consigned to the waste-basket, the better.</i>"</p>

<p>This passage shows how the word, "wealth," tangles
men up inextricably, who, by discarding it utterly, might
have become clear thinkers and useful expositors. It also
shows, that Professor Price never analyzed Valuables into
their three kinds, never thoroughly mastered in a preliminary
way the Idea that underlies Economics, never precisely
understood what Money is, and certainly never found out
the radical nature of Credit. Nevertheless, the passage just
quoted really concedes the whole matter in the present dispute,&mdash;"the
right to acquire that property, even before
possession is obtained, is itself a property,"&mdash;that is all that
we claim, namely, that rights are property, and that new
rights (which are property) are created by Credit, and that
some of these new property-rights thus created may become
and do become a new Capital. These new rights, however,
this new and acknowledged "property," are not "<i>titles</i>"
to any specific valuables whatever, as Price supposed; "<i>a
title-deed or a mortgage</i>" is a totally different thing from a
Credit, since the one always describes and gives a qualified
title to <i>some specific and tangible thing</i>, while a credit-right
is always a claim against <i>a person</i>; the Roman law drew
this distinction perfectly, a credit-right was a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">jus in personam</i>,
while a title-right was a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">jus in re</i>; the common Latin
language as spoken and written marked the difference by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
separate words, a credit-right or true debt was a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Mutuum</i>,
while a title-right or thing loaned was a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Commodatum</i>;
and the Law of our present national banks explicitly
recognizes this universal and fundamental distinction, by
requiring the banks to loan money <i>on personal security
only</i>, that is to say, no tangible things whatever, not even
real estate, are allowed to be taken as <i>original</i> security for
any loan. Banks deal only in true debts,&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mutua</i>,&mdash;and
when they keep custody of concrete valuables&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">commodata</i>&mdash;for
their customers, it is as trustees or bailees
and not at all as debtors.</p>

<p>Our late Oxford friend was far too well informed in
general to contend, that a cheque, for example, is "the
right to acquire possession" of any <i>specific</i> property anywhere;
the drawer has indeed deposited money with the
banker on whom the cheque is drawn, but that money
became the banker's money the moment it was deposited
and no longer his own; the cheque, accordingly, is a
general claim on the banker, and not at all on any special
fund in the banker's hands; it follows, therefore, that the
excess of the banker's average deposits over his average
reserves to secure them, is a new creation of Credit, a
new resource of Production, a new Purchasing-power now
available to the banker not previously and practically
available to anybody, a new Valuable which he proposes
to use and does use for the sake of profits accruing, consequently
a new Capital.</p>

<p>Now let us listen to the objections to this view by a
practical banker, J. H. Walker, of Worcester, Mass., in a
little book of his on Banking published in 1882: "<i>A
man always borrows something of intrinsic value. What he
borrows is not a piece of paper, whatever may be on it, but a
farm, a house, a factory, or a part of them; a store, a mine,
or goods. No man can borrow or lend anything else. The</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
<i>borrower gets from the lender what puts him in possession of
the things he seeks, and it must be some one of these things.
So of all money (except coin). It has no value in itself. It
adds nothing to the capital of the world. It purports to be
and is only a title to property, a convenient device for transferring
the ownership of property.</i>"</p>

<p>This author is led astray by the worse than useless
adjective "intrinsic," having never yet learned that there is
only one kind of value in the world of Economics, namely,
purchasing-power; he sees men as trees walking through
the haze cast over paper-money by John Law in the last
century, as if paper-money must be "<i>based</i>" on something
tangible and specific; he makes a narrow and false assumption
that the only objects ever bought or borrowed are
corporeal "things," denying that the debts in which alone
he deals as a banker are <i>realities</i> as much as any "thing"
can be; and it all comes in his case, as in the case of
hundreds of others, from a totally inadequate analysis of
Valuables into their three separate and virtually independent
kinds, namely, Commodities and Services and Promises.
Mr. Walker, although he writes a book on purpose to do
this, can not explain at all under his view the Deposits and
Discounts of his own bank, and would be as dumb as an
oyster when confronted with the "Cash Credits" of Scotland.</p>

<p>(5) The fifth advantage of the use of Credit, and the
last one to be mentioned in this connection, is, that it
dispenses with the use and wear of large amounts of
expensive Money. It is perfectly certain that Credit
answers many of the purposes of Money. Suppose A has
bought of B $100 worth of goods, and B has bought of A
$125 worth of goods. Three ways are open to close up
these transactions. A may pay B and B may pay A <i>in
money</i>. This would take $225. A may pay B in money,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
and B may send that back with $25 more. This would
take $125. Or A and B may mutually balance their
credit-books, and B pay the difference in account. This
would take but $25. It is clear then, that, as one or other
of these general methods prevails in practice, the quantity
of expensive money required to do the business of a country
is very different. Just so in international trade. Foreign
bills of exchange lessen enormously the quantity of metallic
money that would otherwise have to be transported.</p>

<p>It is not strange that some thinkers and writers, seeing
these unquestionable benefits of Credit even within the
peculiar sphere of Money itself, have come, like Herbert
Spencer and many more, to think and teach that Credit
might answer <i>all</i> the purposes of money. Credit <i>does</i>
take the place of money in part. Can it take the place of
money entirely? Let us see. We have defined Credit as
<i>a right to demand something of somebody</i>, and Debt as <i>an
obligation to render something to somebody</i>; the denominations
of Money are certainly needful in order <i>to measure</i>
this right or obligation; and how can the denominations of
money be established or maintained at all separate from
the use of <i>some</i> money itself as a circulating medium?
Moreover, great as is the undoubted power of Credit, vast
as are these five advantages from its current use, still, each
particular piece or form of Credit waits for something
beyond itself; it waits for its own <i>extinction</i> in future
time; which can only come about in one of three ways,
(a) by <i>set-off</i> against another debt with or without a
balance, (b) by <i>renewal</i> which creates a new debt and
extinguishes the old, (c) by its <i>payment</i> in money; and
now how can these extinctions come about without the
current use of some money, at least to settle the balances
at the clearing-house?</p>

<p>Furthermore, there have always been heretofore in all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
commercial countries longer or shorter periods, called
"crises" or "panics," during which there was a popular
reluctance to accept in exchange the ordinary instruments
of Credit. Money, and much of it, was then found to be
indispensable. Indeed the very advantages of Credit
itself, which have now been explained at length, are
dependent on this, that there be alongside of it to sustain
and limit it, <i>a current and legal measure of Services in
metallic form</i>, in whose denominations Values may be reckoned,
in whose coins the balances of Credit may be struck,
and whose presence secured everywhere by natural laws
alone may enable <i>fulfilment</i> to join hand in hand with
<i>promise</i>. If ever Credit should try to usurp the whole
domain of Money, a tolerable standard of Value or measure
of Services would be no longer possible, Credit itself
would lose its foothold, and the vast balloon of Promise,
sailing for awhile through the blue, the joy of projectors
and the wonder of credulous spectators, would of a sudden
descend to the earth collapsed and ruined.</p>

<p>4. There are too some disadvantages inhering in Credit.
This admitted fact makes no valid argument against the
use and extension of it; because there are disadvantages
connected with all human devices whatever,&mdash;with all
means contrived to reach earthly ends&mdash;and even a child
may discover many of these; some objections lie against
everything, and against everybody, and the practical question
always is, Which preponderates, the good or the evil?
In respect to Credit there can be no doubt, that the good
outweighs the evil many fold; still, in accordance with the
purpose in this book of both writer and readers to look on
both sides of each significant point in Economics, we will
now give attention to the chief disadvantages inhering in
the nature of Credit.</p>

<p>(1) In the first place, when credit is much given by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
dealers to ordinary retail buyers, the reverse results take
place from those but just now characterized as happening
under bank credits, namely, capital passes out from the
hands of productive operators into hands less able and
less willing to use it in further production. Indeed, in
most such cases it ceases to be capital, and is expended in
immediate gratification. It is much easier for the average
man of fair character within the present customs of Society
to "get trusted" than to pay "as he goes." Such a man
is even called "easy-going." He almost always over-estimates
his resources for the future, and under-estimates
his obligations at the present. It is always a disadvantage
in the long outlook for both parties when such men easily
and largely "get trusted." Let us take a sample case:
when an industrious artisan or efficient merchant has
given credit for six months or a year to dilatory customers,
it is so much withdrawn for so long a time from his active
capital; and in order to make up his consequent loss of
profit to the average and expected rate, there must be an
addition to the prices of his wares sold to other parties;
and, besides, some bad debts belong to such a system, and
there must be additional prices somewhere to compensate
for this; and thus the customers who pay promptly bear a
part of the burden of the delinquents, who at least do not
wholly escape, inasmuch as they ultimately (if they pay
at all) pay a price enhanced by their own delay. Thus,
if the current and expected profit on his capital be 12%,
and the artisan or merchant sells and gets returns four
times a year on the average, something less than 3% profit
may be charged to each article on the average; while
if he only gets returns at the end of the year, at best
12% must be put on everything at the average, and in
reality considerably more, because of the bad debts that
stick like a burr to that way of doing business. Hence
the excellent maxim, "Quick sales and small profits."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span></p>

<p>(2) There is a greater inherent <i>uncertainty</i> in values
connected with credits than in those connected with commodities,
or than with those connected with personal services.
We have already seen repeatedly that Value has
its sphere of operations in the Past, in the Present, and in
the Future. There is some uncertainty connected with
what <i>has been done</i> in reference to value, since the market
may prove to have been miscalculated, and the commodities
to have become unsuitable; there is perhaps more uncertainty
connected with what <i>is now being done</i> in reference
to value, because the services bargained and being paid for
may prove to be less steady and skilful than was supposed;
but in the very nature of the case there is still greater
uncertainty connected with what <i>is to be done</i> in relation
to its value, because in the first two cases some at least of
the conditions are already fixed, while in the last one all
of them are at least open to hazard. There is sufficient
certainty in all three of the grand divisions of Time to justify,
and probably to reward, operations in each in reference
to value under the peculiar limitations and conditions of
each, but credits are naturally more sensitive in the law of
their value than either commodities or services.</p>

<p>(3) Largely in consequence of what has just been
expressed under the last head, credit-exchanges are more
likely than commodities-exchanges or than services-exchanges
to become unduly multiplied and consequently
to fail of ultimate realization. The majority of men are
sanguine in relation to the future. Unless they are in
actual contact with their limitations, they are apt to belittle
the rigidity and inevitableness of such limitations. As the
outcome of this, promises are apt to overpass the powers
of fulfilment. No more bales of cotton of any one year's
crop can be actually delivered to buyers, than have been
actually grown and marketed; the services of no more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
men in any capacity can be contracted for and rendered,
than there are men able and willing to work; here are
impassable limits; but the field of the future is buoyant
with possibilities; and hence credits, whose sphere is the
future, though legitimate and potent under the proper conditions,
lie in a field whose limits are invisible, and within
which <i>Hope</i> is ever a tempter to overdoing.</p>

<p>Is speculation proper? Certainly; if by the word
"speculation" is meant the buying of anything with an
expectation based on rational probabilities of being able to
sell it again under different conditions at a higher price.
Speculation in this sense is both proper and beneficial to
the immediate parties to it, and to the general public as
well, because the values of things thus bought and sold
neither fall so low nor rise so high as they otherwise would
do, which is a public gain. Speculators as a rule buy
on a falling market, <i>which tends to lift it</i>, and sell on a rising
market, <i>which tends to lower it</i>. It is better for all
concerned, that the necessaries and conveniencies of life
should bear as steady a market as is possible in the nature
of things, summer and winter, year in and year out; and
the ports of every nation should be open with the slightest
possible hindrance in the way of tax to the corresponding
necessaries and conveniencies from abroad, whenever combinations
and "corners" attempt to lift their prices beyond
the level determined by a natural and free Supply in contact
with the current Demand.</p>

<p>Credits occupy the field of Probabilities; that is to say,
probabilities seeming to be such to men of sharp insight
and cultivated forecast. When such men <i>on such grounds</i>
buy and sell "futures" in cotton or corn; when they buy
and sell stocks either "short" or "long"; when they seem
to themselves to perceive a sound reason for lurching over
from the "bulls" to the "bears," or <i>vice versa</i>; and when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
they really think that what they are wont to deal in has
touched bottom in price, and they buy now in view of a
rise, Economics has nothing to say in blame of any or all
of these operations, for they are the same in substance and
motive as all other buying and selling; but nevertheless,
it has this to say, that all these operations in credit-futures
lie adjoining to and in dangerous proximity with another
field, for operations within which it has nothing <i>but</i> blame
to utter. Gambling occupies the field of Chance. There
is a great difference between chances and probabilities.
Political Economy has no trouble in drawing a fast and
hard line between them.</p>

<p>But practically the operators in credit-futures experience
an immense difficulty in keeping within this line of rational
probabilities. The coolest heads are apt to become heated,
and to lose sight of distinctions, in the close air of the
Stock Exchange and the offices circumjacent. Some operators
openly confess they know nothing which way the
index of reason points, by buying "straddles," as they are
significantly called. A friend and old-time pupil, who has
for years been accustomed to these excitements in New
York, said recently to the writer,&mdash;"<i>The Stock Exchange
is a great gambling hell, and that's all there is of it!</i>" In
buying and selling of all kinds, both sides gain: in gambling
of all kinds, what one side gains the other side loses:
therefore, under a sound money, healthful public opinion,
and good law, gambling never can become formidable. In
every lottery scheme, no matter how honestly managed,
the sum of the <i>prices</i> of the tickets is greater than the sum
of the <i>prizes</i> offered, otherwise nothing would be left for
the profits of the managers; therefore, he would be a very
foolish man, who should buy all the tickets of a given lottery
with the certainty of drawing all the prizes; and <i>he</i> is
a still more foolish man, who should take his <i>chance</i> of
drawing all the prizes by buying two or ten tickets.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span></p>

<p>(4) Another and a principal Disadvantage of Credit is
seen in its usual action on <i>prices</i> through increased Demand,
and its consequent tendency to bring about Commercial
Crises. Any man's whole purchasing-power is made up of
three items: first, the property in his possession; secondly,
the values that are owed to him; and thirdly, his credit.
He can buy services of the three kinds with these three
valuables; and the sum of his power to buy is exactly
measured by the aggregate of these three valuables under
his control. But while the first two, his property and
debts due, are limited and ascertainable, the third (his
credit) is indefinite and undeterminable beforehand. Being
based upon <i>confidence</i>, which is itself sensitive and variable,
a man's credit at one time may be vastly greater than at
another, compared with his other two means of purchase;
and if he have the reputation of doing a safe and regular
business, and is favored by circumstances, he will find
himself able sometimes to buy on credit to an extent out
of all expected proportion to his other capital. When,
therefore, credit is offered and received for commodities,
it has the same influence upon their prices as when money
is offered and received for them. It follows, consequently,
that there is likely to be a general rise of prices whenever
there is an extension of credit for the purpose of purchasing;
indeed, when money only is used to buy with, there
can not be a <i>general</i> rise of prices, because while more
money may be spent on some things, and they rise in
price, there would be less money for other things, and <i>they</i>
would rather fall in price; but when credit is used freely
in addition, and increased purchases go on in all departments
at once, there is apt to be a rise of prices as to all
commodities and a universal spirit of speculation.</p>

<p>At such times, and while prices are still rising, men
<i>seem</i> to be making great gains; everybody wishes to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
extend his operations by means of all his money and all
his credit; and forms of indebtedness are multiplied on
every hand. By and by it begins to be perceived in certain
quarters that the matter has been overdone; speculative
purchases cease; banks become particular whose paper
they discount; men find it difficult to sell their debts due
in order to provide for their debts owed; they fall back
on the sale of their commodities, but when holders are
anxious to sell, prices always fall; a panic now sets in,
more irrational, if possible, than the previous overconfidence;
their inflated credits and commodities collapse in
the hands of their holders; sales at great sacrifices are
inadequate to meet the mass of maturing debts contracted
when confidence was high; men fail, and must fail; the
banks cannot help them, or think they cannot; and so
wide-spread commercial disaster comes in.</p>

<p>Such commercial crises swept over the United States in
1837, 1857, and 1873; and will doubtless recur in the time
to come. They always arise from disordered credits, and
though not necessarily connected with credit-money, are
much more likely to come in connection with that. The
more strong and conservative the Banks maintain their
ordinary condition, the more powerfully can they operate
to prevent or abate a panic. They ought always to be
on the shore and never in the stream. From the very
nature of banks and of the motives that create and operate
them, they are apt to sell for a profit in ordinary times
about all of the credit they safely can; unless, then, they
foresee a stringency some time ahead, and curtail their
loans, and otherwise keep their position strong in reserves
and deposits, they will be powerless to help even their
most deserving customers when the panic sets in; even
then by a special association with other banks in the same
city for reciprocal support during a crisis, as was happily
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
brought about in New York some years ago, something
may be done for their common constituency and good customers
to help them out of trouble by discounts continued
to them; especially as it is not money so much that is
needed to allay a panic, nor even credit actually given, as
it is a general knowledge that abundant credit can and
will be given either by some pre-eminent bank, like the
Bank of England in London, or by an association of banks
for that special purpose, like the agreement just referred
to as entered into temporarily by the banks of New York
city. As a panic becomes imminent anywhere, some Bank
or banks there ought to be in a position to extend their
discounts freely, at a high rate of interest indeed, so as
to discriminate between customers urgent for and deserving
of discounts, and another class whose need of accommodation
is not so sore, and a third class who are sure to
fail if the Panic stalks forward.</p>

<p>A permission given of the Government to the Bank of
England to overpass under these circumstances the Discount-limits
laid down by the Bank Act of 1844, has on
three several occasions acted like a charm to still the
ragings of a commercial storm. On each of these occasions,
1847, 1857, and 1866, the Bank was forbidden by
the Privy Council to discount for less than 10%.</p>

<p>As the inclined plane of rising prices is slowly ascended
before a Crisis, so the fall of general prices
afterwards seems to be rather gradual also till the lowest
point of them is reached, from which another ascent is
apt to commence. The following table taken from the
<i>New York Public</i> of the first week of November, 1881, is
instructive on both these points. Taking the prices in
1860 of 43 articles of prime necessity, which constituted
then and afterwards about &#190; of the commerce of the
country, as the normal standard or 100, the table gives the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
comparative gold prices of the same for four years previous
to 1873 and for seven years subsequent, as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>(5) A penultimate Disadvantage of Credit may be
noted in the facility which it offers for contracting great
national Debts. There are certain aspects, under which a
Nation may be properly regarded as a moral person, and as
such person may pledge the public faith for the present
and the future, becoming a debtor to its own people or to
foreigners, and thus a public debt may be made a sort of
mortgage on the national property and income. Now, it
cannot be fairly denied, that incidental advantages may
spring up in connection with such a national debt: for
example, the bonds, which are its evidences, may open up
to the people a convenient form of investment for presently
inactive capital, and for trust funds of all kinds;
there can be little doubt that certain classes of persons
holding these national obligations are won thereby to a
stronger patriotism and become better friends to stability
in government, although this consideration applies mainly
to new governments and to those temporarily endangered;
both England and the United States now make a portion
of their public debt the basis of a national system of
Banking, but it is perhaps questionable whether this can
be justly put among the incidental benefits of the Debts;
and again "a moderate debt adds to the credit of a Nation,
and its ability to raise money in an emergency, for bankers
and capitalists are more ready to take such securities as
they are in the habit of dealing in" (Sidney Homer).
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span></p>

<p>On the other hand, the burdens of a National Debt are
very apparent: for example, the annual <i>interest</i> charge to
the Union at the close of our late civil war was $150,000,000,
which gradually declined by the lowering of the
interest-rate and by the paying off of principal to $61,368,912
for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1881; between
March, 1869, and August, 1873, the United States paid
$378,015,065 on the principal of its public debt; the collection
of the Internal Revenue alone of the national government
cost for the fiscal year 1867, $7,712,089; and in each
of the two years, 1870 and 1881, a little over $101,500,000
was paid out to reduce the principal of the Debt. All
those vast sums came out of the industry and income of
individuals; and taxation to any degree as all this implies
is a mighty disturbance to industry, and gives rise to an
army of officials who eat out a considerable percentage of
all they collect. Moreover, the various expedients of taxation,
which are always practically unequal in their operation,
are apt to give rise to irritation and political agitation,
and even sometimes to threats of repudiation, especially
when the occasion has gone by under which the debt was
contracted, and another generation is called upon to pay
off a debt it had no agency in creating.</p>

<p>Here the vexed question arises, how far has one generation
<i>the right</i> to throw upon succeeding ones the burdens
of a National Debt? The true answer to this question is,
<i>it has a very limited right indeed</i>. The opposite doctrine
implies tacitly when not openly, that the succeeding generations
will have no occasion for extraordinary expenses of
their own, and, therefore, may rightfully be made to contribute
to the extraordinary expenditures of this generation.
But it is pure assumption to take for granted, that
the next generations will not have, of some kind or other,
as much occasion for an extraordinary effort in the way of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
defence or of improvement as the present generation has
had. It is a common but harmful illusion to estimate
what has now to be done as of much more importance than
what will have to be done. Therefore, to throw the present
burden forward on another generation of men, who are
likely to have to make their own special exertion, just as
great and just as imperatively called for, is a procedure
unwarranted by past experience. The view that has long
prevailed in practice, that a great War-debt, for example,
might be easily and justly cast upon posterity, has again
and again given rise to needless and expensive wars; <i>those</i>
have been called upon to pay the piper, who perceived the
utter inutility of the expenditure; and thus bitterness has
been added to burden.</p>

<p>Besides, the men to fight the battles, and the capital by
which to feed, clothe, and furnish them the munitions of
war, <i>must come from that generation</i>; and there is always
great injustice in the manipulations of a great debt ostensibly
incurred to obtain this capital, and the debt itself is
usually in large part rather a memorial of the war than of
the means by which its expenses were actually defrayed.</p>

<p>The generation of American citizens not yet wholly
passed off the stage was called on in the Providence of
God to suppress a Civil War of enormous proportions, and
to eradicate a social institution that was thoroughly bad;
the expense of doing this was many fold enhanced by
timorous counsels in the field, by class legislation in Congress,
and by wretched financiering in the Cabinet; but
the Debt, vast as it was, and needlessly incurred as a large
portion of it was, has already in good part been paid off
and must be entirely paid off by the generation that incurred
it. That this great task may be thus completed,
will require (1) an economical administration of the national
Government; (2) an avoidance of intervention in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
the affairs of our Neighbors, and of entangling alliances
with Foreigners; (3) a free Commercial System, under
which the taxes shall be adjusted only towards the most
productive revenue; and (4) a constant and onerous home
Taxation.</p>

<p>(6) The final Disadvantage of Credit is this, that it is
apt to confuse the minds of men as to its own nature, from
its apparent resemblance to something else, which is at
bottom wholly unlike it. The people of the United States
have suffered greatly from this confusion, and are likely to
suffer from it still more in the time to come, both in their
property and progress at home and in their good name
abroad; and it becomes all good citizens, and especially all
those called upon to pronounce on the Law of the Land, to
know thoroughly the radical difference between a <i>Credit</i>
and a <i>Quittance</i>, and so to escape the contagious confusion
that has entered and stirred up the popular, and even the
judicial, mind of this country. All through the present
chapter has been insisted on and illustrated the point, perhaps
to the weariness of the reader, that Credit is always
essentially the <i>Promise</i> of one person to another, and that
whatever is thus <i>Promised</i> is necessarily and fundamentally
different from the Promise itself. To confound those two
things as if they were or could be made one and the same
thing, is in thought illogical and in practice execrable.</p>

<p>And yet it must be allowed, that there is somewhat in
the nature of Credit, that makes this confusion plausible,
or else it never would prevail; and also that there is something
more still to make it plausible in the nature of
Money, which last point can only be cleared up in the next
following chapter under that title.</p>

<p>Mr. E. G. Spaulding of Buffalo, in his copious and excellent
History of the Legal Tender Act, "all of which he
saw and part of which he was," as the chairman of the subcommittee
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
of the Ways and Means at the time the Act was
passed, demonstrates the extreme reluctance of everybody
concerned to give a forced circulation, that is, a compulsory
legal-tender quality, to the first batch of Treasury
Notes to the amount of $150,000,000 in February, 1862.
We have already noted in another place in this chapter,
that two successive batches of similar Notes, each to the
same amount as the first, were issued within less than a
year. These Notes then and since called Greenbacks, bore
at the time four essential features: first, they were both in
terms and in reality <i>national Promises</i> to pay to the bearer
gold dollars of the then and present standard of weight
and fineness, because there is no other possible meaning
to the words "<span class="smcap">The United States will pay to the
Bearer Five Dollars</span>"; second, in addition to their being
a forced loan from the people to the amount of notes
authorized, they were given a <i>forced circulation</i> as money
by means of the clause, "<i>and shall also be lawful money
and a legal tender in payment of all debts public and private
within the United States except duties on imports and
interest on the national bonds</i>," which clause still recognizes
gold dollars as the only universal and standard money;
third, the notes were made <i>fundable</i> in sums of fifty dollars,
"or some multiple of fifty dollars," in six-per-centum gold
bearing bonds of the United States, then called 5-20's,
again in this clause recognizing the radical difference
between the legal-tender paper promises as money and the
gold dollars promised in them, in which gold money the
interest and principal of the bonded debt must still be
paid; and fourth, these notes were publicly known and
acknowledged by the Issuer and the receivers to be presently
<i>irredeemable</i>, since the Government did not have, and
did not pretend to have, any coin with which to redeem
them, and everybody knew that they were made a legal-tender
<i>because</i> they were irredeemable.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span></p>

<p>These prompt recognitions of the impassable gulf between
a Promise and what is Promised, were confirmed
by all that happened afterwards. The notes, notwithstanding
they were legal tender and all bonds of the
United States could at first be bought with them at par,
almost immediately began to droop as compared with gold.
The daily quotations showed a pretty steady decline for
two years. On Jan. 15, '64, gold in greenbacks was
100:155; April 15, 100:178; June 15, 100:197; June
29, 100:250, that is, 40 cents to the dollar; and July 11,
100:285, or 35 cents to the dollar in gold, their lowest
point. From this depth they slowly rose with many fluctuations
back and forth from many causes for 14 years.
Jan. 1, 1879, they became redeemable in gold, and have
so continued till the present time.</p>

<p>When the Civil War was all over, and these startling
vicissitudes of the paper money were measurably forgotten;
though no prominent man, when they were
passed, thought the Legal-Tender Acts constitutional;
the paper money began to be popular; the distinction
between a promise and its fulfilment began to fade out
of the minds of the people; there had always been bank
bills circulating as money in the country; these had been
called "dollars" equally with the coin; and in December,
1869, a test case, Hepburn <i>versus</i> Griswold, was decided
by the Supreme Court on the question, whether Congress
had the constitutional authority to make anything but
gold and silver lawful money in satisfaction of <i>contracts
entered into before the first legal-tender Act was passed</i>. The
question, Can Congress make such notes a legal tender
for contracts made <i>after</i> the passage of the Act? was not
involved in this case; but it was very clear from the
Opinion of the court delivered by Chief Justice Chase,
that the majority of the justices regarded the Act as being
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
unconstitutional in its application to contracts made <i>after</i>
as well as <i>before</i> the Act was passed. Upon the special
question before the Court, the justices were divided in
opinion; five, including the Chief Justice, agreed that the
Act was invalid so far as it made the notes a legal tender
on <i>contracts executed prior to its enactment</i>; and the three
other judges were of the opinion that it was valid. Of
course, the Decision of the Court was rendered by a
majority of two, that the Act was unconstitutional.
Chase, Nelson, Grier, Clifford, and Field constituted the
majority; Miller, Swayne, and Davis, the minority.</p>

<p>Salmon P. Chase was one of the greatest men of the
great period of the Civil War. He was Secretary of the
Treasury at the time the greenbacks were issued, and they
were issued at his instance and advice, but he was opposed
to the clause that made the notes a legal tender. He
never expressed the opinion that the Legal-Tender Acts
were constitutional, nor did he expect that the notes, of
which these authorized the issue, would ever become a
permanent national money. This is evident from the fact
that the notes were made <i>fundable</i> at his instance, not so
much with the view of keeping up the value of the notes
by giving them a present market in bonds, as with the
view that they would help the sale of the bonds and would
be absorbed by them as soon as the price of the bonds was
above par in greenbacks. Afterwards Mr. Chase thought
that this <i>fundability</i> of the notes into bonds would so far
take up the notes as to stand in the way of the negotiation
of further necessary loans to the Government, and at his
instance this provision of the law was repealed. Consequently,
there was nothing inconsistent between his position
as Secretary and his later position as Chief Justice.
He was undoubtedly right in both of these positions.
The making the greenbacks legal tender did not probably
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
add one particle to their purchasing-power, but rather the
reverse, because that feature implied a doubt on the part
of Congress itself as to the validity and currency of such
national promises-to-pay. That he was also right in his
judicial opinion and decision, however subsequently overruled
in his own Court, may be safely left to the inevitable
future appeal to common sense and to the common principles
of constitutional interpretation.</p>

<p>This judgment in Hepburn <i>versus</i> Griswold was favorably
received by the country at large, as being just in the
line of the great decisions of Chief Justice Marshall, and
as being exactly in accordance with Amendment X of the
Constitution, namely, "<span class="smcap">The powers not delegated to
the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited
by it to the States, are reserved to the
States respectively, or to the people</span>." The State
of Massachusetts particularly, which has always maintained
and still maintains a strong doctrine of State
Rights as over against, though in harmony with, the
Rights of the United States under the Constitution,
applauded this judgment as sound in law and politics, and
as righteous altogether. But the then administration of
General Grant, inexperienced alike in law and politics, and
linked in entangling alliances with the great corporations
of the country, received the Decision with marked dissatisfaction;
and it was especially offensive to the huge railroad
companies, whose bonds had been executed prior to
Feb. 25, 1862, inasmuch as it made the principal and
interest of these bonds payable in coin, which they had
hoped to pay off in the depreciated greenbacks, made
legal tender for all debts.</p>

<p>The Administration lost no time in trying to bring
about by fair means or foul, a reversal of this unwelcome
decision. E. R. Hoar of Massachusetts, at that time attorney-general
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
in Grant's Cabinet, was the principal agent in
accomplishing this end by means so discreditable that he
lost in consequence his popularity in Massachusetts and all
chance of further political preferment. The means chosen
and put into effect was the appointment by the President
of two new judges, Strong and Bradley, the first to take the
place of Grier, resigned, and the second appointed under a
law increasing the number of judges to nine, whose opinions
on the point at issue were known beforehand, and
who were selected to serve on that very account. "<i>It was
no secret, indeed it was a matter of public notoriety, that
these justices were appointed in order that the decision of
1869 might be reversed. Their opinions in regard to the
constitutionality of the Legal-Tender Acts had been clearly
and publicly expressed. It was therefore pretty well known
what the decision would be when the question was again
presented.</i>" (Hugh McCulloch.)</p>

<p>The second Legal-Tender case, accordingly, that of
Knox <i>versus</i> Lee, decided in December, 1870, reversed the
judgment of a year before, <i>no new points therefor being
raised either by the new judges or by counsel in the new
trial</i>, the Chief Justice and his three former associates still
adhering to their original opinions. It was then five
judges to four, the special question being, Is it constitutional
to make promises-to-pay a legal tender on contracts
executed before the promises were issued? The judicial
answer was in this case, Yes; provided Congress regarded
such action as a necessary means of preserving the Government
in time of War, or any other period of extraordinary
emergency. That is to say, <i>bona fide</i> creditors were
constitutionally bound to receive depreciated notes as legal
tender in satisfaction of contracts entered into when no
notes were in existence; to receive on contracts specifically
calling for "<i>dollars</i>" the depreciated notes of the Government
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
merely promising to pay "<i>dollars</i>," but on which
the "<i>dollars</i>" could not be obtained! What is that, but
the monstrous incongruity that <i>a promise</i> is the same
thing legally as its <i>fulfilment</i>? What is that but judicial
blindness as to the <i>nature</i> of Credit? What is it but
the old confusion between <i>names</i> and <i>things</i>? What is it,
finally, but the dazed and hazy vision, pardonable perhaps
in the popular mind but half-opened to radical distinctions,
but unpardonable in learned men professing to lay
down the law in a civilized country?</p>

<p>It is scarcely needful to add, that the Supreme Court of
the United States suffered in the judgment of good citizens
by that transaction; that the best legal and financial
opinion of the country yielded little respect to a decision
<i>thus secured</i>; and that intelligent people do not believe
that constitutional law <i>can</i> sanction what contravenes at
once common sense and common morality.</p>

<p>Judge Field (and his memory the country will not willingly
let die), one of the majority in the first decision, and
writing the opinion of the dissenting minority in the second,
used this strong but just language, "<i>It follows, then,
logically, from the doctrine advanced by the majority of the
Court as to the power of Congress over the subject of legal
tender, that Congress may borrow gold coin upon a pledge to
repay gold at the maturity of its obligations, and yet in direct
disregard of its pledge, in open violation of faith, may compel
the lender to take, in place of the gold stipulated, its own
promises; and that legislation of this character would not be
in violation of the Constitution, but in harmony with its letter
and spirit. What is this but declaring that repudiation
by the Government of the United States of its solemn obligations
would be Constitutional?</i>"</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V.<br />

<small>MONEY.</small></h2>


<p>The subject of Money presents few difficulties, or rather
none of any depth, to one who has thoroughly mastered
the subject of Value. To all others the difficulties are
insuperable. Essay after essay and volume after volume
has been written in this country upon Money, by men
who would have become good economists and good monetaries,
if they had only begun their inquiries at the right
place and followed them in the right direction. As we
saw in the last chapter that it is impossible for anybody to
understand the subject of Credit without first comprehending
the matter of Value, so we shall see in this chapter
that in the order of Nature Value precedes Money, and
that the latter can only be learned in the light of the
former. The logical reason for this in general is, that
Money itself is always a Valuable, and comes to its function
as money only through a comparison of itself with
other Valuables.</p>

<p>The thin difficulties that confront the student of Money,
who has reached the topic along the proper highway cast
up for economical inquiries, arise apparently from two
sources; and we will begin our present discussion by first
looking at these in their order.</p>

<p>In the first place, Money is the only Valuable that may
belong to two out of the three possible categories into
which Valuables may be scientifically thrown. All Valuables
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
are either Commodities, or Services, or Credits.
These categories never change places. Once a Commodity
always a commodity, so long as value can be predicate
of it; a personal Service can never take on any other valuable
form; and a Credit is ever a credit, and nothing else,
until it is annihilated by Fulfilment. Now Money is the
only Valuable that ever appears in two of these forms.
The same Dollar indeed cannot be both a Commodity and
a Credit; but some Dollars are a Commodity cut out from
gold and silver, and some other Dollars (so-called) are a
Credit issued by Government or parties responsible to
government; while Money as a general term properly
enough covers both kinds of Dollars, the Commodity-Dollar
and the Credit-Dollar. In other words, Money is of
two kinds, and only two kinds, either a Piece of valuable
metal stamped as to weight and fineness by the image and
inscription of Cæsar,&mdash;a Commodity; or a Promise to pay
to somebody some of these pieces,&mdash;a Credit. This unique
peculiarity of Money, by which, always a Valuable, it may
appear and does appear in two out of three possible predicaments
of Valuables, makes a little difficulty at the
outset of its discussion, and requires continued care in
formulating its scientific propositions.</p>

<p>In the second place, a more considerable difficulty, and
yet a slight one still, is found in the fact that the choices
and the legislations of men have more to do in shaping
the propositions of Money than in most other economical
propositions. It is true, that Nature and men coöperate
in the determination of every case of Value whatsoever;
while there is a difference in the cases, though perhaps not
a distinction, in respect to the fixedness and universality
of the natural laws involved, in contrariety to the purely
human impulses concerned. The Providential elements
in Economics, both the social and the physical, are of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
course relatively fixed and unchangeable, otherwise Science
could not grapple with and classify them; and so also are
those principles of Human Nature related to exchanges,
which may be said to be <i>universal</i> in their character,&mdash;such
as, for example, the preference to receive a larger
rather than a less return-service, and to render a smaller
rather than a larger effort; and at the same time there
are other principles of human nature related to exchanges
much more <i>variable</i> in their character than these, such, for
instance, as the nation's choice of the kind of Money it
will use, or the kind of Taxation it will impose. It certainly
follows from this, that some Economical laws must
be more <i>general</i> than others, owing to a less variation in
the human impulses concerned in them: it follows, for
example, that the law of landed rents, or the law of the
approach of the price of raw materials to that of the finished
products, is more universal in its terms of generalization
than most of the propositions of Money and Taxation
can be.</p>

<p>It seems like a paradox, that those parts of Economics
in which the human elements of variable choice may
predominate over the relatively fixed laws of nature and
of mind, should be just the parts hardest for men to catch
clearly and hold firmly; because, we naturally think, that
difficulty and mystery are rather to be found in those
departments in which an Infinite Mind has been at work
upon an infinite plan, and that there is no such profundity
in the works of men; but after all, even those natural
laws like Gravitation, which are clear and universal as
laws, if they be such as the devices of men have to do
with, such as may be modified and in a certain sense
controlled by human actions, become from that very
circumstance liable to some difficulty and perhaps to some
mystery. Now all the truths of Money, and as we shall
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
see in the final chapter all the truths of Taxation also,
belong to this class of less general generalizations; still,
it is scarcely less than foolish to say, that Money is such
an elusive and ideal agent that nobody can understand it.
That is the language of indolence and lack of penetration.
Money is wholly a matter of man's device, though it comes
into constant contact with something greater and more
fixed than itself; it was invented, just as any other instrument
is invented, to accomplish a certain economical
purpose; and it would be strange indeed if men by taking
pains could not perfectly comprehend what men themselves
have wholly devised. We hope, accordingly, in
the following paragraphs to clear up completely to all
intelligent readers the whole doctrine of Money. The
key to unlock all the superficial difficulties (and there
are no others) is this: Money is always a Valuable before
it becomes money, and continues a valuable independently
of the fact that it <i>is</i> money; and, it is always one or other
of two kinds, either itself a Commodity or a Promise to
pay a commodity. In this chapter, we will not begin
with definitions and justify them afterwards, but will
come up to them step by step, and, as it were, justify them
beforehand.</p>

<p>1. Economical Exchanges may begin, be profitable to
both parties, and go forward to a certain extent, without
the use of any money at all. As a matter of fact and
probably for a long time, while the Civilizations were
gathering their inchoate forces for a further progress, men
exchanged one Service directly for another without the
intervention of any medium. This form of trade is called
Barter. King Hiram of Tyre furnished to King Solomon
of Judea a certain quantity of cedars from Mt. Lebanon
for the building of the new Temple at Jerusalem, and
Solomon in return furnished to the Tyrians a certain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
quantity of wheat and oil, Judea being a fertile agricultural
country with no forests, and Tyre a wooded country
with no farms. This may well serve us as an instance of
Barter, although Money had been in current use in those
regions a thousand years before, as is seen in the purchase
by Abraham of the cave and field of Machpelah, for which
he weighed out "<i>four hundred shekels of silver, current
money with the merchants</i>."</p>

<p>It is obvious, however, that while Barter is a good deal
better than no exchanges at all, there are inherent and
immense difficulties in that form of trade.</p>

<p>(a) Under Barter trade is extremely limited in its
<i>personnel</i>. Only those parties can engage in it, each of
whom is in position to render to the other just such a
Service as the other is in direct and immediate need of,
and each of whom also wants another Service in kind and
quantity exactly what the second man has to render. It
is not enough under these conditions, that a man should
have some Service to sell, but he must also find some
other man, who not only wants that specific service but
who also has some service to render in return just such as
the first man wants. If A has wheat which he wishes to
exchange for a coat, he must first find a party desiring
wheat and also having a coat to sell, and moreover who
wants just as much wheat as will pay for a coat, no more
and no less; if he wants more, he may have nothing to
render for the excess which A is willing to accept; if less,
A may have nothing besides wheat with which to help pay
for the coat. Even in the simpler states of Society the
inconveniences of thus hunting up a specific market for
each specific service are very great, and in more advanced
states of civilization would become intolerable, if it were
possible (as it is not) for Society to become advanced
under such conditions.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span></p>

<p>(b) Barter presents insuperable obstacles to trade in
point of <i>place</i>. While men still exchanged in kind, as it is
called, and knew no other mode, the purchasing-power of
any Service was necessarily confined to that locality, and
would not be parted with except in view of a return
service actually there present in the same place. There
could be no commercial contact without a local contact.
The ultimate parties to every exchange must come together
face to face. There could be no middle-men or
distributors. The market was circumscribed to the
hamlet.</p>

<p>(c) Buying and selling under the scheme of Barter is
also wretchedly limited in point of <i>time</i>. The fruit-dealer,
for example, must dispose of his product quickly, or it
perishes on his hands. So of many other commodities.
If they are to be sold at all, they must be sold quick.
The ultimate buyer must be on hand in time. As the
result of these three concomitants of Barter, ten thousand
things that are now bought and sold to profit never came
to a market or thought of a market, exchanges were so
limited in time and place and variety, human associations
were so hampered, and the development of all peculiar
talents so impeded, that one of the initial steps in the
progress of all Civilization has been to hit upon some
expedient to lessen these intrinsic difficulties, and so to
facilitate Exchanges.</p>

<p>2. The Invention of Money was nothing in the world
but the tentative selection by certain people in a certain
locality of some Commodity then and there <i>valuable</i>, that
is, capable of buying <i>some</i> things then and there, and
gradually giving to that commodity by general consent
the capacity of buying <i>all</i> things then and there salable.
The commodity thus slowly becoming money, whatever it
was, had and must have had a <i>limited</i> purchasing-power
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
to start with, because no instance to the contrary has ever
been shown, and still more because that peculiar comparison
between <i>two</i> things that lies at the bottom in each
single case of Value is exactly the same kind of comparison
that holds between money and the <i>many</i> things which
money purchases; given a <i>valuable</i> in common use as a
starting-point, and the transition is easy and natural to
a <i>generalized</i> valuable, that is, to a recognized money; the
relation of mutual purchase between the commodity and <i>some</i>
other things was a common fact to begin with, the making
it money was merely the common consent that thereafter it
should have a general purchasing-power within the circuit;
so that as a simple result, whenever anybody had anything
to exchange, he might first exchange it for this selected
product, which was valuable before but is now generally
valuable, and then with this money-product in hand he
could buy whatever he might want at any time or place
within the circuit.</p>

<p>It is impossible from the very nature of Value, impossible
from that comparison of two distinct Services, that
precedes every Exchange, as well under Money as under
Barter, that anything except a valuable anterior to and
independent of its becoming money, could ever have become
money at all. Money makes no alteration in any
law of Value, but only substitutes for convenience' sake in
every transaction in which it plays a part, a general for
a specific purchasing-power; a book, for example, has a
specific purchasing-power, since there is somebody who
wants it, and is willing to give a sum of money for it; and
the owner of the book by the sale of it parts with a product
which has only the power to purchase something from a
few persons, and receives a product in return which has
the power to purchase something from all persons; it is
not true to say that the money is worth more than the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
book, because they are just worth each other, as is demonstrated
by the sale; but it <i>is</i> true to say that the seller
of the book has substituted in the place of a limited
purchasing-power, of which he was proprietor, a general
purchasing-power, of which he has now become proprietor;
that is, that the command of the money, which has no
larger value than the book had, does carry along with it a
superior command over purchasable articles generally.
In one word, Value in the form of money is in a more
available shape for general buying and selling than value
in any other form. This is the exact and ultimate expression
for all the truth there is in the common vague remark,
namely, that Money is something different from all other
Valuables; it <i>is</i> different from them in just one respect,
namely, while they have the power of buying some things
from some persons, it has the power derived from the <i>consensus</i>
of Society to buy all sorts of things from all sorts of
persons.</p>

<p>This simple change or substitution, which seems in
itself so little and easy and natural, has changed in its
ever-enlarging results the face of the world! It makes
the valuable now selected to be money seem to the minds
of men to be a very different thing from what it was
before, although the change in itself is slight indeed. It
removes most of the inconveniences of Barter as by a
stroke of the hand. So soon as a commodity selected to
become money by one people comes to be acceptable as
such to all other peoples, as is the case with gold, the
advantages of its use are vastly multiplied to all. Experience
has shown many times over, and reflection will
explain to any one, how that there is no other machine
that has economized labor like money; no other instrument
that plays so deep and broad a part in Production;
no invention whatever, unless it be the invention of letters,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
which has contributed more to the civilization of mankind.
Money makes vast distances relatively indifferent;
for it is sufficient to constitute a market for any valuable
that it is practically wanted anywhere on the round globe,
the middle-man paying the seller for it in money transports
it thither, and receives back his investment with a profit
from the ultimate buyer. So, also, money generalizes any
purchasing-power in point of time. The dealer, exchanging
his perishable products for money, may keep its power
of purchase locked in this form as long as he lists, putting
an interval at his own pleasure between selling and buying,
and with this generalized power in his pocket he may
buy when he will and what he will and where he will.
Money, too, makes any purchasing-power portable, divisible,
and loanable. A man may carry the value of his
farm in his purse, and may divide it up for a thousand
different purchases, and especially is able to loan it in this
form in order to receive it back again with interest at a
future day.</p>

<p>3. It is important to notice in the next place, that,
whatever made the commodity selected as money originally
desirable and valuable, it has now become desirable
and valuable for other and wider reasons. The tobacco of
Virginia, for example, in the early days of that Colony,
became valuable at first on account of the demand for it as
a narcotic both there and in England; but as soon as it
was made a legal money in the Colony by the general
consent already described, its value depended in part upon
another set of causes. Of course Demand and Supply still
controlled its value just as before, only certain parties who
had not desired it before as a mere <i>commodity</i> thereafter
desired it as a current <i>money</i>. Its convenience and necessity
as money widened the circle of those parties willing to
receive it and glad to render a return for it. It is true,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
that many now received it only because they could pay it
out again to buy something else with; but that made no
difference so far as Value is concerned; it was valuable
before under a certain limited demand, and continued valuable
under an additional and broader demand; we cannot
certainly say, that it became <i>more</i> valuable under this new
and wider demand, because we do not know how the then
combined demand affected the Supply. We may probably
say, that the value became <i>steadier</i> if not <i>larger</i>, under the
double demand than under the previous single one; and
the vital point to mark and remember is, that the <i>value of
money</i>, previously valuable as a commodity only, is still
maintained under the law of Demand and Supply, just as
all other values are, the only peculiarity being this, namely,
as a generalized valuable and consequently a potent social
agent money is in demand by everybody who has anything
else to sell.</p>

<p>It follows from this in necessary sequence, that Money
as such, whatever may have been the ground of its original
value as a commodity, <i>is always received as money in
order to be parted with</i>. It is not bought for its own sake
to be used and enjoyed, as most other things are, but is
only bought to be sold again. Men will sell everything to
buy it, with the sole intent to sell it again to buy something
else; and the odd thing about it is, that everybody
buys it to sell again, not at all as the speculator buys grain
to sell it again at a higher price by the bushel or centner,
but, the money remaining constant in their minds, they
sell for it something they care less about in order to buy
with it something they care more about. Money, therefore,
becomes a <i>medium</i> in men's exchanges. The word
"medium" in this proposition is to be taken in its etymological
and strict sense, as something that comes between
two extremes and serves also to relate them to each other.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
This is not the ultimate characteristic of Money, as we
shall see, nor can a final definition be founded here, but it
is a good step towards ultimates to see that money is exchanged
for other things as a means and not as an end, that
it is a great help in exchanging all other valuables but is
never exchanged for itself in an ultimate transaction.</p>

<p>Small boys, indeed, sometimes swop cents; but men, the
miser excepted, who is under a deplorable fallacy of the
senses, use and estimate money mainly as the <i>medium</i> that
facilitates the real exchanges of Society. What is actually
and ultimately exchanged is the wheat, the cloth, the lumber,
the furniture, the commercial service of every kind,
and Money is but the instrument making those exchanges
easy, which might perhaps go on in part without it, though
with difficulty and loss. In short, money is somewhat like
a railroad ticket. Transportation to a given place is what
is really bought when one pays for a railroad ticket. The
proof of the purchase is the bit of paper exhibited. That
comes in as a <i>medium</i> between the traveller and the railroad
company; and while it facilitates the real exchange,
it also partly disguises it. This comparison holds good in
the main feature, but in two respects the resemblance fails:
Money is not a specific ticket for a single purpose, as the
pasteboard is, but is a general ticket (so far as it goes), for
all purposes of purchase; and secondly, Money really
stands as a value in its own right (so far as any single
thing can so stand) at the same time it is serving as a
<i>medium</i>, while the railroad ticket does not. Still, we are all
desirous to get money, not for the sake of the money itself,
but for the sake of those things which the money will buy.
We part with money freely and constantly for those things
which we care more about. What we exactly care for is
what our money will buy, is the conscious command over
all services and commodities which the possession of money
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
insures to us. If we could give our own commodity or
service or claim, whatever it may be, and receive directly
in return the claim or commodity or service which we
want, whatever that might be, there would be no need of
money at all; but this is always inconvenient, and generally
impossible; and, therefore, we introduce a middle term,
and money is found to be a good mean to help exchange
the two extremes.</p>

<p>4. We are now getting on towards a just conception
and a true definition of Money, though two or three more
points must still be noted as preparatory to that consummation.
As a result of the fact already reached, that
money serves as a <i>medium</i> in men's exchanges, it follows
of course that the power of money as such a medium is
multiplied by what has been called <i>rapidity of circulation</i>,
that is, a brisker use of the volume already in circulation
will reach the same end as the increase of its volume. As
in mechanics, so in money, the whole power is the product
of mass and velocity. Money also is like any other tool,
the more constant its use the more profitable its agency.
The quick movement of a small mass, accordingly, is better
than the torpid movement of a large mass, both in what
it saves of expense, and in what it presupposes of the general
conditions of exchange. The value of the money-volume
of any country is a small fraction of the aggregate
value of those products which the money helps directly to
exchange; and a very small fraction indeed of the aggregate
value of all the products which it helps indirectly to
exchange through Credit by means of its <i>denominations</i>.
We shall see better a little farther on, that Money works
not only as a medium direct, itself exchanged against other
Services, but also as furnishing those denominations of
Value, like the <i>dollar</i>, which are always used in bargaining;
and also used in all cases of Credit, in which settlement
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
is not made by money but by offsetting one piece of
indebtedness against another, and these denominations can
arise only from the use of money as a direct medium.
Therefore, we may say that the hub and the spokes and
the rim of the wheel of exchange consist of personal services
and commercial credits and all material commodities
except money, while, to borrow the famous comparison of
Hume, "Money is but the grease which makes the wheel
turn easier." It would be a vast mistake to suppose, as
some of the ancients did, that the grease is really the
wheel.</p>

<p>While Money thus facilitates the revolution of the
wheel of Exchange, it follows too from its nature as a
medium, that the dimensions of the wheel as a whole are
vastly greater than they would have been but for the
Money. Money indeed helped to exchange the products
that already existed and were coming into existence at its
first invention, but by far the largest part of products since
have come into existence largely through the agency of
Money. We get quite too low a view of the functions of
this potent agent, if we think of it merely as an aid in circulating
products, that would have existed whether or no;
some products would certainly have existed whether or
no, and money would surely be of great use and convenience
in helping bring these to the ultimate consumers;
but this is a partial and wholly inadequate view of the
function of Money as a medium of exchange. The fact
that such a medium is in universal circulation, and that
the present holders of it are ready to exchange it against
any sort of Services adapted to gratify their desires, exercises
a kind of creative power, and brings a thousand
products to the market which would otherwise never have
come into existence. Since money will buy anything, men
are on the alert to bring forward something which will buy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
money; and since Money is divisible into small pieces, an
incredible number and variety of small services are brought
forward to be exchanged against these pieces, for example,
into railroad cars and fares of all sorts, which services we
have no reason to suppose would ever be brought forward
at all were it not for the strong attraction of the money.</p>

<p>5. From this last point of view we may gain another
closely connected with it, namely, that Money must be a
very important part of the <i>Capital</i> of the world. We
have already thoroughly learned that Capital is any
product outside of man himself from whose use springs a
pecuniary increase. Now any one may see that the monetary
medium of any country is the most active and the
most essential and the most profitable of all those instruments
reserved in aid of further production. The axe, the
plough, the spindle, the loom, the wheel, the engine, are
all instruments, are all Capital, and they each aid respectively
some part or parts of the processes of Production;
but Money is a form of Capital which stimulates and facilitates
all the processes of Production without exception.
Just as we have seen that Money is a form of Value generalized,
so is it also a form of generalized Capital, that is
to say, it is an instrument capable of aiding all processes
of Production in every department, while every other capitalized
instrument is capable of aiding but few processes
in one department. Without Money, for instance, there
could be no thorough Division of Labor, because there
would be no adequate means of estimating or rewarding
each one's share in a complicated process. By means of
Money all services small or great contributing towards a
common product are neatly measured, and may be paid for
by some one, who thereby becomes proprietor of the whole
product; or, if the contributors choose, they may wait till
the product itself is sold, and then the money received is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
divisible without loss to each contributor, according to the
service rendered. Thus the influence of Money as Capital
pervades the whole field of Exchange from centre to
circumference, facilitating every transfer and stimulating
new transfers.</p>

<p>Now then, if Money be, as it is, a peculiar kind of Capital,
since it is a Medium in all Exchanges, the question
becomes pertinent, How much of it is wanted? Clearly,
only <i>so much</i> as will serve the <i>purposes</i> which such a
medium is fitted to subserve; there should be enough fairly
to mediate between the Services actually ready to be exchanged
then and there, and also enough fairly to call out
other Services proper and profitable in the then circumstances
of Society, and whose only obstacle to a profitable
exchange then and there <i>is a lack of a facilitating medium</i>.
All increase of the volume of money beyond this point,
which the very nature of Money itself marks out as the
boundary, leads to a diminution of Value of every part of
it, to a consequent disturbance of all existing monetary
contracts, to a universal rise of prices which are illusory
and gainless, to unsteadiness and derangement in all legitimate
business, and to a spirit of restless enterprise and
speculation which seeks to draw off the excess of money
in untried and reckless experiments. The only real subjects
of Exchange are mutual efforts, mutual services, as
these are expressed in Commodities and Services and
Credits, and money is the instrument merely that comes in
between the real exchanges to facilitate them; and, therefore,
it seems to be perfectly conclusive on this point to
remark that the quantity of money needed in any country
or the whole world is limited by the number of the services
ready to be exchanged, to make easy the exchange of
which is the good purpose and sole end of Money.</p>

<p>The physical and mental powers of man, which alone
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
can give birth to commercial services, when considered as
they must be in this connection as belonging to a given
number of men at a given time and place, are strictly
limited of course; and although the presence of money
then and there is both a stimulus and an aid to all these
men to bring forward services of all sorts to the market,
there are obvious restrictions both in their powers and in
their circumstances; and the quantity of money needed
among them is just that quantity which will fairly act as
a medium in exchanging the services which they are able
and willing to render to each other. All increase in the
quantity of money beyond that point would have, and
could have, the only effect of increasing the nominal Prices
of Services, without making the services themselves any
greater in number or better in quality.</p>

<p>It is with Money exactly as it is with any other form of
Capital, allowance being made for the fact that Money is a
kind of generalized capital. To illustrate, How many ships
does a commercial nation need to employ? As many as will
fairly take off its exports and bring in its imports. Ships
are wanted for one definite purpose; and when enough are
secured to answer that purpose, all additions will lessen the
Value, that is, the purchasing-power, of ships generally.
So of all instruments whatever. Enough is as good as a
feast. Enough is better than more. In regard to every form
of Capital, and consequently in regard to Money as such, the
point of sufficiency is determined by the quantity of work
to be done. And as no law of Congress is required to
determine how many ships are best to do the transportation
for the people of the United States, so no legislation is
needed to fix the amount of Money that is best for the
same people, or for any people. As the people find out
for themselves how many steam-engines they want to do
their work of the year, so they find out without any aid
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
from their legislators how much money they want to make
their exchanges of the year. The less Law and the more
Liberty on all such points the better for all concerned.</p>

<p>Let the reader notice in passing, as a corollary from
what has just been shown, that when forms of Credit like
bank cheques come into growing use to make payments
with and settle balances, they displace to a large extent
commodity-moneys, like gold and silver, which would otherwise
have to be employed. Speculations, and even scientific
discussions, over the needful amounts of gold and
silver for money in the United States, have usually overlooked
this essential consideration of displacement; and
one result of this has doubtless been too large a coinage of
the precious metals, to the hazard of their stable value,
and especially to the hazard of the permanent maintenance
of the gold standard. Men forget in their zeal for Money
that it is nothing but a Tool, and that the multiplication
of tools beyond the amount of work to be done by means
of them always makes the tools a drug; and they are apt
to forget also that the cheaper and more convenient substitutes
for metallic moneys, namely, forms of Credit, are
all the time and more and more taking the place of the
older moneys, which, nevertheless, must still be kept at
the foundation, though a lessened quantity of them be
needful for circulation.</p>

<p>6. We must now carefully sink our analysis one grade
deeper, in order to reach the bottom characteristic of
Money, and so to formulate an ultimate definition of it.</p>

<p>The only quality common to all valuable things is the
fact that they are all <i>salable</i>; and if these various and
multitudinous valuables are ever to be made in any way
commensurable with each other, it must be by means of
one of their number assumed as a <i>standard of comparison</i>
with the rest. Comparisons can only turn on points of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
<i>likeness.</i> The single respect in which all valuables whatsoever
resemble each other is their common possession of
purchasing-power, be it more or less. Therefore, as a
yardstick, itself possessed of length, <i>and because it is possessed
of length</i>, if assumed as a standard of comparison
with other objects that have length, may be used to measure
all such objects whatsoever, and may accurately express
in units or fractions of itself the simple length of anything
and everything; so, any valuable may be selected as a
<i>standard</i> with which to compare all other valuables, and
by means of the terms of which to express numerically
the reciprocal relations between all valuables whatsoever.
This is just what is done whenever any valuable is selected
as Money; and this is the exact and single purpose of such
selection.</p>

<p>What is the precise change, then, in the valuable chosen
as Money when it becomes money? This: it was a valuable
before, else it could not by any possibility serve the
present purpose, but now it has become a <i>standard</i> valuable,
with which other valuable things may be compared
in the single point of their <i>value</i>. Valuables are now
commensurable. That is all. But that is a great deal.
As we have already learned to the nail, Valuables are all
Services; and now some one Service has been selected
from the rest, capable in its very nature of <i>measuring</i> all
the rest, and so capable of becoming immensely <i>useful</i> to
mankind.</p>

<p>What, accordingly, is the bottom characteristic of
Money? And where shall we find the terms for an immutable
definition of it? <i>The core of Money is this quality of
being a Measure of Services, taken on in addition to the
usual and universal qualities constituting anything a Valuable.</i>
This additional quality arises under the choices and
action of men, just as the ordinary qualities constituting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
anything a valuable arise under the choices and action of
men. But it is an <i>additional</i> quality, distinctly conferred,
and vastly important. The valuable chosen as Money was
a Service to start with, was constantly rendered as such
then and there, and was consequently fitted by qualities
already possessed to assume a further and a <i>unique</i>
quality, namely, the capacity to measure and express
relatively to itself all other valuable Services whatever.</p>

<p>As each and every Valuable is the outcome of a <i>comparison</i>
instituted by two persons as between two things,
as is thoroughly unfolded in the first Chapter, it is not at
all strange, rather it is natural and inevitable, that there
should arise in connection with Valuables as a whole class
some such further <i>comparative</i> measure, as Money is now
shown to be; because, without some such common measure
of Services in general, itself a Service of the same kind, it
would be inconvenient, not to say impossible, to carry on
any considerable traffic anywhere. For instance: a baker
has only loaves of bread, and wishes to buy a hat, a horse,
a house. How many loaves shall he give for each? Unless
there be some common Service, in the terms of which
these differing Valuables can be expressed, and by means
of which they can be brought into commercial relations
with each other, it would be an awkward piece of business
to effect even the <i>three</i> exchanges; and every time the
baker wished to buy another article, there must be a rude
and slow calculation from independent data, in order to
decide upon the terms of the exchange. Let now some
Common Service be introduced, in the terms of which each
of these values can express itself independently, and the
difficulty disappears in an instant. "My loaves are worth
ten cents each," says the baker. "My hat is worth ten
dollars," says the hatter. Their saying so does not indeed
<i>make</i> it so; that matter is a preliminary; but each has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
come to that approximate conclusion by a relatively easy
comparison of two Services, his own and another common
one; and if the loaves will duly bring ten cents and the
hat ten dollars, the terms of their own exchange are one
hundred for one, and there is no need of parleying. So of
the rest; so of everything that is ever bought and sold.
Money becomes by common consent a Measure of them;
because it measures them, it makes the interchange of
them a very facile matter; because it measures them, it
easily becomes a medium between them; and, accordingly,
because the money rendered is itself a Service, it is a natural
and universal measure of all other Services.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Money is a current and legal measure of services.</span>
With this final definition of "Money" the writer
is more than willing to take all the risks. It was new
when propounded many years ago in one of the editions
of his earlier book. All subsequent testings of it in form
and substance have but confirmed the original confidence
in it. The word "legal" in this definition is not always
to be pressed to its utmost signification, but denotes anything
sanctioned by law or usage <i>equivalent to law</i>. The
other words are to be taken in their full and technical
meaning. It is believed that, while this definition is short
and simple, it just covers the whole ground and no more.
It is not enough that a certain valuable be "legal" as
Money; it must also be "current" in order to be a true
money. In the United States between 1862 and 1879, to
take an example, gold coins, though legal tender all the
time for all debts public and private, were not "current"
in the full sense of that term, and hence were <i>not</i> the
Money of the country. Till the last-mentioned date, the
gold dollar of 25&nbsp;<sup><big>4</big></sup>&frasl;<sub><big>5</big></sub> grains standard fine was required by law
to pay customs-taxes with and the interest on the public
debt, and was used to a small extent in a few branches of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
private business, and was not otherwise in the hands of
the people. These dollars, accordingly, were not strictly
money, but bore a premium over the "current" money
of the country. To be Money, then, a Valuable must be
recognized as money by law or custom as strong as law,
and also circulate among all classes of the people as a
medium in their exchanges.</p>

<p>But we are bound to observe that Money becomes a
<i>medium</i> in men's exchanges, because it first became a
<i>measure</i> in their Services. Some economists think that
these two functions are separate, and are of equal rank;
but it is easy to see that one only is original, and that the
other is derived from that. Even Aristotle perceived that
Money is a Measure, inasmuch as he defined property "<i>anything
that can be measured by money</i>." We may be pretty
sure, in opposition to Professor Jevons, in his Money and
the Mechanism of Exchange at page 13, who thinks there
are <i>four</i> characteristics of Money, that Money as such has
but <i>one</i> primary characteristic difference from other forms
of Value, namely, this <i>measure</i>-quality, this <i>standard</i>-quality,
this publicly recognized function as a <i>common measure</i> to
which all other valuables are constantly referred. This
additional attribute put upon a money-valuable by law or
custom is not what <i>makes</i> it valuable, since an ounce of
uncoined gold standard fine is worth within a very small
fraction as much as an ounce of gold coins, but it makes the
money a far more convenient instrument to purchase with,
inasmuch as money, having now the attribute of making all
other valuables easily commensurable with itself, becomes
at once something which everybody is ready to receive,
because everybody knows in general what its power will
be to purchase all other things. In other words, Money
becomes a <i>medium</i> in exchanges just because it has already
become a <i>measure</i> of Services in general; and there are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
not consequently two prime functions of Money, still less
four, but only one. This view seems to simplify the whole
subject of Money very much; and we may be sure that it
will be found to be scientifically correct, and that we shall
find many means of testing its accuracy as we go on.</p>

<p>To maintain, as we do, that "Money is a measure of
Services," is much better than to say, in connection with
many economists, that "Money is a Measure of Value."
That phrase is objectionable because Value is always relative
to two Services exchanged for each other; and to say
that money is a measure of that <i>relation</i> is neither so simple
nor so ultimate as to say that it is a measure of each of the
Services entering <i>into</i> that relation. The Services may be
conceived of and spoken of separate from the Value into
which they merge, although they come into existence
solely for the sake of that resultant Value, and it is more
exact and final to propound that Money, itself a Service, is
a measure of all other Services considered as constituent
elements of the Values into which they fall. We are not
without strong hopes, accordingly, that competent economists
will concede, that here is a radical improvement in
the nomenclature of our Science.</p>

<p>In the place of our expression and definition, and the
foregoing explanation consequent upon its use, President
Walker in his Money, pages 280 <i>et seq.</i>, prefers the
mathematical and excellent phrase, "<i>the common denominator
in exchange</i>"; Professor Bonamy Price, in his
Practical Political Economy, page 363, shows his fondness
for the formula (and it is a good one), "<i>the tool of
exchange</i>"; and Henry Dunning Macleod, in his Elements
of Banking, page 17, insists with much less reason,
that "<i>Money is the representative of Debt</i>." He says:
"The quantity of money in any country represents the
amount of Debt which there would be if there was no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
money; and consequently when there is no debt there
can be no money." The unfortunate use by some countries
of a paper money, which is indeed a form of debt,
gives some plausibility to the notion that Money is a
representative of Debt; and perhaps the fact that Money
is often used to pay debts previously contracted, and that
debts are almost always contracted in the terms of Money,
may give some additional plausibility to this view; but
as Macleod himself goes on to say that "no substance
possesses so many advantages as a metal for money," and
that "all civilized nations therefore have agreed to adopt
a metal as money, and of metals, gold, silver, and copper
have been chiefly used," we do not see how he can logically
hold that a gold dollar, or a gold sovereign, whose value is
as substantive and independent as that of any Valuable in
the world can be, becomes through coinage and circulation
"a representative of Debt." Instead of saying as he does,
"where there is no debt there can be no money," it may be
confidently asserted on the other hand, where all transactions
are settled at once in solid money there can be no debt.</p>

<p>7. Having thus looked into the nature of Money, and
seen what is its one essential characteristic, and its one
obvious and universal function as the result of that, it
will help us now in our further discussion, to examine
some of the material commodities that have served as
Money at different times and places.</p>

<p><i>Cattle</i> appear to have been the earliest money of which
there remains any record. Homer, near the middle of the
sixth book of the Iliad, indicates in the following lines
that oxen were an incipient money in the Heroic age:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Then did the son of Saturn take away<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The judging mind of Glaucus, when he gave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His arms of gold away for arms of brass<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Worn by Tydides Diomed,&mdash;the worth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of fivescore oxen for the worth of nine."<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span></div></div>

<p>We cannot certainly infer, when it is said in Genesis that
"Abraham departed out of Egypt very rich in <i>cattle</i> and
silver and gold," that any of these were anything more
than articles of valuable merchandise; but on the other
hand it is certain from the Latin name of Money, <i>Pecunia</i>,
which is derived from the root <i>pecus</i>, which means "<i>cattle</i>,"
that Cattle were the Money of the early Romans; and
Pliny writes expressly that King Servius Tullius stamped
the first bronze money of Rome with the <i>image of cattle</i>,
undoubtedly indicating by that some equivalence in current
value between the two. At any rate cattle have
been used as Money among pastoral peoples very widely
in place and in time, and are still so used in various parts
of Africa.</p>

<p>In the region of the Euphrates and Tigris the precious
metals became money in very remote antiquity; for the
art of coining, and all other arts, came thence westward
to the Greek cities of Asia Minor, and to Greece itself,
and we learn that Pheidon, King of Argos, coined silver
money on a scale derived from the East in 869 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>; and a
better proof still is the fact that burnt clay tablets are
found in the Royal Library at Nineveh, discovered by
Layard, which are really credit-money, notes issued by the
Government, and made redeemable in gold and silver
money on presentation at the king's treasury. Tablets of
this character are extant bearing date as early as 625 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>
But the gold and silver money must have been circulating
a long time in their own right as valuables, before such
a credit-money, such a promise-money, as those tablets are,
could have originated in connection with them. Abraham,
who himself migrated from "Ur of the Chaldees"
about 2000 years <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>, not long after reaching the Mediterranean,
"weighed unto Ephron the silver which he had
named in the audience of the sons of Heth, four hundred
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
shekels of silver, current money with the merchant."
This is expressly said to be "money" and "current
money." Perhaps it was coined money. At any rate, it
was cut and piece money. It was indeed weighed out,
and not counted out. This is still the more accurate and
speedy manner, when the facilities for the weighing are
present. The Bank of England at this day weighs, and
not counts, the coins received and paid out. The Romans
first coined silver money in 269 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>, and gold money in
207 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>, and gold coins were stamped in Greece about
the time of Alexander the Great, say 333 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span></p>

<p>Other metals than those called precious were also early
used as money. Long before Pheidon's silver coinage in
Greece, <i>copper skewers</i> were used as money in that country,
of which six made up a <i>drachm</i>, which was afterwards
both a coin and a unit of weight, the coin being worth
about 17 cents of our money, and the weight being about
66 grains avoirdupois. The word drachm is derived from
<ins title="Note: Greek 'dragma'">&#948;&#961;&#7936;&#947;&#956;&#945;</ins>,
<i>a handful</i>; and the sixth part of it, called an <i>obol</i>,
from the Greek word meaning a <i>spit</i>, became also both a
coin and a weight, all which makes it evident that these
were used in connection with roasting meat, and that one
skewer or obol was originally a unit both of value and of
weight. In Adam Smith's day, in certain districts in Scotland,
<i>nails</i> were still used as small money, which is a forcible
reminder of these old Greek skewers. Iron became
money in Sparta; money of lead was known to the ancients,
and is still current in the Burman empire; the
earliest Roman coins were of copper, which were cast
rather than stamped, for no die would have sufficed for
pieces so large and heavy, and the <i>denarius</i> was the unit
divided into ten <i>asses</i>, the <i>denarius</i> being nearly the equivalent
of the Greek <i>drachma</i> whether of copper or silver,
because the Romans reckoned from the first the ratio of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
copper to silver as 250:1; bronze is a mixture of copper
and tin, and brass of copper and zinc, and copper coins
with both these admixtures&mdash;used for the purpose of hardening
the copper, it being a general law of metals that a
mixture of two is harder than either&mdash;have been very common
in ancient and modern times; Sicilian, Roman, and
old British coins of tin alone are known to have been
struck; and Herodotus makes the statement that the
Lydians of Asia Minor were the first to make a coinage of
<i>electrum</i>, which, as some claim, was a mixture of gold and
silver, and of which ancient specimens are still existing.</p>

<p>Cowry <i>shells</i> are still used in the East Indies, and also
in Africa in the place of small coins, and have sometimes
been imported into England from India to be exported in
trade to the coast of Africa, being reckoned in Bengal at
about 3200 to a silver rupee, which is about 46 of our
cents. The New England Indians also used beads or
shells of periwinkles (white) and of clams (black), of
which 360 made up a belt of <i>wampum</i>, as they called it,
the black being counted worth twice as much as the white;
and the English colonists accepted the wampum in their
exchanges with the Indians, regarding a string of white as
equal to five shillings, and a string of black to ten shillings,
and afterwards made it legal tender among themselves
for small sums, and even counterfeited it. Cakes of
<i>tea</i> have passed as money in India, and elsewhere; and it
is said, that at the great annual fair at Novgorod, in
Russia, the price of tea has first to be determined before
the prices of other things can be settled upon, since that is
a kind of standard of Values in that great mart. <i>Salt</i> has
been current money in Abyssinia; <i>cod-fish</i> in Ireland and
Newfoundland; and <i>beaver-skins</i> in New Netherlands, New
England, and the western parts of America.</p>

<p>We do not here try at all to give a full list of the things
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
that are known to have been used in the early states of
society as money; and there would be no ground for surprise
in any list, however large and varied, when we remember
how great is the need of some such form of value
generalized in order that exchanges may grow to any considerable
size and vigor. Two points only need now to be
noted, (1) that the tendency everywhere has been sooner
or later to come to the metals as the best form of money,
and among the metals to reach gold and silver as the only
ultimately satisfactory materials for Money; and (2) that
no instance has ever been found in the whole stretch of
inquiry over all the earth, of anything becoming a Money
that had not been previously a Valuable. We might be
perfectly sure of this beforehand, without any search at all
among the moneys of primitive times and states of civilization,
because, from the <i>very nature of the case</i> nothing
could ever serve the purpose of Money except what was
already a valuable to make the comparison with,&mdash;nothing
could ever possibly serve as a measure of services except
a service. It has several times been claimed, that actual
exceptions to this law have been historically discovered,
but when the alleged exceptions have been closely scrutinized
they have been found to be apparent only. To take
two or three of the most plausible examples: the Carthaginians
had a kind of leather money, which originally enclosed
bits of the precious metals, and circulated in virtue
of them, though they afterwards came to circulate as bits of
leather only, as counters and pledges, in a way that will be
explained later. According to the Venetian traveller, Polo,
China had in the thirteenth century a money made of the
bark of the mulberry tree, cut into round pieces and stamped
with the name of the sovereign, which money it was death
to counterfeit or to refuse to take in any part of the empire.
If we had the whole history of this money, it would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
surely ally itself either with the other commodity-moneys
now being treated, or with the modern credit-moneys made
legal tender to be treated hereafter. It is just as certain
as anything can be, that these circles of stamped bark did
not start out as money in their own right. The French
writer, Montesquieu, asserted that there was in use in the
last century among the people of the coast of Africa, what
he called "an ideal money," "a sign of value without
money," the unit of which was called a <i>macoute</i>, which
was subdivided in ideal tenths, called <i>pieces</i>. This statement
was startling, as implying a denomination without
the thing denominated, as implying a standard of value
which had no basis in a valuable thing. It was afterwards
discovered, however, that this money of account had its
origin, just as we should suppose it must have had, in an
actual <i>macoute</i>, a piece of stuff, a fabric, which they had
used first as a commodity-money, and afterwards its <i>name</i>
as a money of account. A valuable thing may become
money, and then its name may become a <i>denomination</i> of
value, and still later a bit of leather or a bit of paper may
be called by the same name, and in a certain sense take the
place of the same thing. All this will be as clear as day
pretty soon.</p>

<p>8. Contrary to what has often been affirmed by Economists,
the real measure of Services is the service itself, the
<i>thing</i>-dollar and not the <i>denomination</i>-dollar. The denominations
are used in bargainings and calculations as representatives
of the money itself, and thus indeed in a secondary
sense serve as <i>measures</i>; but the subtle connection
between the thing and its name, between money and its
denominations, and the differences between the two, need
to be clearly unfolded, because most of the current fallacies
about money take their rise just at this point. An
illustration will best serve us here. The original measure
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
of Services in France and England and Scotland was the
pound weight of silver. No coin of that weight was ever
struck; but the pound of silver was cut into 240 coins
called pence. Twelve of these pence were called a <i>solidus</i>
or shilling. Thus, as applied to silver, the symbols lb. and
£ denoted equivalent weights, the former of uncoined
metal, the latter of metal coined. But in course of time,
more "pence" than 240, and at last in Elizabeth's reign
744 "pence were coined out of a lb. of silver." Yet all the
while 240 of these pence were called a £. £ and lb., both
a contraction of the Latin <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">libra</i>, were no longer equivalent.
The lb. of weight continued stable; the £ of money had
dwindled to less than one-third. Yet the <i>name</i> pound
continued to attach to 240 pence, although the pence
embodied a less and less quantity of silver. Each actual
penny had less silver in it, and though it was still called a
penny as before, the <i>denomination</i>, though spelled and
sounded as before, represented less silver, and therefore
less <i>value</i>, than before. The denominations, then, always
follow the fortunes of the coins, whose names they are, to
the frequent loss and shame of the unthinking, who suppose
the same <i>name</i> must represent the same <i>thing</i>. Unfortunately
it does not.</p>

<p>Take another illustration. In 1834 the gold eagle of
the United States was reduced in weight from 270 to 258
grains troy, and the alloy increased from one part in 12 to
one part in 10. These changes took out more than 6 parts
of gold from every 100 parts in all the gold coins of the
country. Yet all these coins bore the same names as
before. The things denominated changed, but the denominations
changed not. Other things remaining equal, the
coins lost six <i>per centum</i> of their purchasing-power, or in
other words, general prices rose in that proportion; the
<i>measure</i> became so much smaller; and the names, <i>eagle</i>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
<i>dollar</i>, outwardly unchanged, varied simultaneously and
equally with the change in the coins.</p>

<p>Also, coins are liable to change in their function as a
measure of general Services from unavoidable changes in
the general purchasing-power of the precious metals themselves.
If for any reason an ounce of gold will buy less
of general Services than formerly, of course the coins cut
from that gold will buy less than formerly; and this
change in the <i>measure</i> is followed instantly and inevitably
by a corresponding change in the meaning, though not in
the spelling, of the <i>denomination</i>. Not so with all other
tables of denominations. These have a <i>basis</i> independent
of the things which they help to measure. The French
<i>metre</i>, for example, is not variable by the lengths or
breadths or heights of the things it measures, but is an
invariable unit of length the world over; so is one of
Troughton's inches; but this feature does not hold at all
of the denominations of Money; because <i>sovereigns</i>, <i>dollars</i>,
<i>marks</i>, <i>francs</i>, are denominations of <i>Value</i>, which is itself
a variable relation. Such denominations, consequently,
are <i>not</i> an independent standard to which values themselves
can be referred, as lengths are referred to metres
and inches, but vary with the varying purchasing-power
of the coins themselves. The "<i>dollar</i>," as a denomination,
means more or less, just according as the "<span class="smcap">Dollar</span>," as a
coin, buys, that is, measures, more or less.</p>

<p>Still, essential as is the point now made to any just
understanding of the subject of Money, it is vastly important
for all the interests of Exchange that the accepted
measure of Services be as little liable to fluctuations as
possible, especially in all cases in which lapse of time is
involved before the exchange is fully consummated. An
inflexible standard there cannot be from the very nature
of the measuring, but also from the very nature of all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
measuring, the money-standard should be and should be
kept as nearly inflexible as it possibly can be. For the
same reason in kind, only multiplied a thousand-fold in
force, that the bushel-measure should be of the same
capacity in sowing-time and in harvest-time, to sell and
buy by, always a bushel, no more and no less; and the
yard-stick an inflexible measure of length, always 36 of
Troughton's inches, no more and no less; so, as far as it is
possible in the nature of Values, ought the current measure
of Services, and hence its denominations, to represent,
year in and year out, a uniform degree of purchasing-power.</p>

<p>9. This brings us logically to the historical fact, that,
no matter what measure of services any people may have
adopted in their primitive times, there has always been a
steady force at work tending to displace these in favor of
gold and silver. This has become the universal result the
world over among all advanced peoples. Governor Bradford
in his History of Plymouth Colony gives a quaint account
of the origin of money among the Pilgrims, and in connection
with that of the fee-simple in lands: "<i>The Pilgrims
began now highly to prize corn as more precious than silver,
and those that had some to spare began to trade one with another
for small things, by the quart bottle and peck; for
money they had none, and if any had, corn was preferred
before it. That they might, therefore, increase their tillage
to better advantage, they made suit to the governor to have
some portion of land given them for continuance and not by
yearly lot, for by that means that which the more industrious
had brought into good culture (by such pains) one year came
to leave it the next and often another might enjoy it; so as
the dressing of their lands were the more sleighted over and
to less profit; which, being well considered, their request
was granted.</i>"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span></p>

<p>The neighboring Colony of Massachusetts, settled about
ten years later, used Bullets for small change, reckoning
them at a farthing apiece, and made them legal tender for
debts of less than one shilling; for larger exchanges Wampum
and Beaver-skins were long used; but the steady
force just spoken of induced Massachusetts in 1652 to
supplant these with a silver coinage of her own, called the
Pine-tree shillings and sixpences and threepences and twopences.
This mint existed (sometimes idle) for over 30
years, but all the pieces coined bore the dates of 1652 or
1662. In 1691, the two Colonies were forced into one
government through a new charter granted by William
and Mary; and after lengthened trials of inferior moneys,
not needful to be described now, Massachusetts determined
in 1749 to have no other than silver money circulate
in the Colony, and became thereafter till the Revolution
the so-called "Silver Colony," and business rapidly and
steadily revived and enlarged in consequence of the
change, and in contrast with the rest of New England.</p>

<p>Gold and silver, thus ever urging their way in to take
the place of tentative and transient standards, and ever
coming back again to stay if displaced for a time by
cheaper and changeable moneys, have never been anywhere
of equal value, weight for weight. An ounce of
gold has always been more valuable than an ounce of silver.
Probably in the Euphrates country where coinage
began, and certainly in Asia Minor deriving thence its
weights and measures, gold was strictly the standard with
silver as subsidiary to that; in Greece, when Philip's victories
established a double standard there, gold was reckoned
relatively to silver as 1:12&#189;; in the Roman world,
where silver had been the standard after 217 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>, Augustus
Cæsar legalized gold as a co-standard in the ratio of 1:12;
in 1717 a double standard was established in Great Britain,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>
gold being rated in the coinage as 1:15<sup><big>1</big></sup>&frasl;<sub><big>5</big></sub> of silver, but in
1816 by a law still in force, gold was made the sole standard
for the United Kingdom, the legal use of silver being
limited to 40s. in any one payment; in France the legal
relation of gold to silver was fixed in 1803 as 1:15&#189;, and so
continued till 1876; in the United States the ratio first
established, in accordance with the recommendation of
Alexander Hamilton as Secretary of the Treasury, was
1:15, but in 1834 this was changed to the relation of
1:15.98, and so it remains to this day; in 1871, the new
German Empire adopted the sole gold standard, and limited
silver to the amount of 20 <i>marks</i> in any one forced
payment, still allowing the old silver <i>thaler</i> to circulate at
the rate of three marks to a thaler; and since 1875, the
Scandinavian Union permits gold alone to be coined for
private persons, and limits the debt-paying power of silver
to 20 <i>crowns</i>. A crown is 26.78, and a mark 23.82, of
our standard cents.</p>

<p>Moreover, the relative value of gold in silver never continues
the same for any great length of time, even after
the law has sought to ascertain and fix it. Indeed, any law
fixing the ratio between the two has very little, if any,
effect towards maintaining the ratio. Demand and Supply
determine the value of the precious metals each in each
at any one time as absolutely as they decree the value of
Hindoo rice in silver. France managed to maintain her
legal ratio at 1:15&#189; for 73 years, because all the conditions
were on the whole favorable; but when the Germans threw
a portion of their silver on the world's market in hopes to
reach the single gold standard, and the mines of Nevada
poured forth on the same market their millions of silver,
the ratio could no longer stand, the right of private individuals
to have silver coined for them was taken away in
behalf of the government, and only the five-franc silver
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
pieces continued to be legal-tender to all amounts, the
other silver coins becoming then (1876) only legal to pay
debts to the amount of fifty francs. A franc is 19.29 of
our standard cents.</p>

<p>And this brings us to notice what are called <i>subsidiary
coins</i>. France, England, Germany, and the United States
have debased their smaller silver coins in weight, so that
the <i>nominal</i> value of these coins is from 7 to 15% above
their <i>bullion</i> value. For example, two halves, four quarters,
ten dimes, of our silver since 1875 weigh 385.8 grains,
which is also the exact weight of the French five-franc piece,
while our standard silver dollar weighs 412&#189; grains, both
<sup><big>9</big></sup>&frasl;<sub><big>10</big></sub> fine, so that our "subsidiary" silver is debased in weight
6.48%. There are three advantages in thus treating the
smaller silver: (1) there is so much clear profit to the
Government minting them, thus lessening taxation; (2) a
security to the peoples that they shall not lose their convenient
small change by export to neighboring countries;
and (3) this scheme allows a very considerable rise in the
market value of silver without tending to throw the subsidiaries
out of circulation. As these are never legal-tender
except to very small amounts in domestic trade, there are
no serious objections to their use in limited quantities.
The English can pay debts in their silver to the amount of
£2, and we in ours to the extent of $5. Coins of copper
and of other inferior metals are also <i>subsidiary</i> in principle
and motive. Our 5-cent and 3-cent nickel pieces are
75 parts copper and 25 parts nickel, and the 1-cent piece is
95 parts copper and 5 parts tin-zinc; and debts of 4 cents
can be paid in 1-cent pieces, of 60 cents in 3-cent pieces,
and of 100 cents in 5-cent pieces.</p>

<p>10. The steady experience of civilized men for two milleniums
and a half seems to demonstrate, that gold and
silver constitute the best Money; and we must now investigate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
the reasons, one by one, <i>why</i> they are the best money.
The reasons appear to be three. Of these the first is by
much the most important.</p>

<p>(1) The first and main reason why gold and silver
make the best money is to be found <i>in their comparatively
steady general Value</i>. Since Money is a Measure of all
other valuables, its success as a measure must depend on
its own <i>steadiness</i> of value, and gold and silver meet this
test better than anything else. Money is a valuable, and
not in any sense a <i>representative</i> of value; except as to
the subsidiaries, a coin does not owe its value at all to the
<i>stamp</i> impressed upon it or to the <i>law</i> authorizing it, since
the metal in it is worth as much out of the coinage as in
it; coin-values arise under the same conditions as all other
values, and are variable by any change in any one of the
four elements which alone can vary the value of anything;
and it would seem that nothing more is needed in order
to remove the last vestiges of the dark cloud which has so
long overhung this subject of Money, than to familiarize
ourselves first of all, as we have already done, with the
true doctrine of Value in general, and then to hold fast
the truth exemplified on every hand, that the value of
Money is just like every other value. Let us examine
then, first, why the value of gold and silver is so steady.</p>

<p>(a) On account of the comparatively steady Demand for
these metals. Gold and silver are wanted for two general
purposes: first, to be used as money, and second, to be used
in the arts; and the usual estimate is, that about <sup><big>2</big></sup>&frasl;<sub><big>5</big></sub> of the
aggregate quantity in the world is in the form of money,
and the other <sup><big>3</big></sup>&frasl;<sub><big>5</big></sub> in the form of plate and utensils and ornaments.
Now, so far as the element of Desire controls
Value, the purpose for which any article is desired is a
matter of indifference. The aggregate desire for it for all
purposes, accompanied with the offer of something with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
which to buy it, constitutes the Demand; and the more
universal the desire, no matter for what use, the steadier
the Demand and so far forth the steadier the Value. It is
a point still too little noticed, that the combined demand for
the precious metals for all uses is what helps determine
their general value, and not the demand for them as coin
alone; just as the value of barley is regulated partly by
the demand for it for food, and partly by the demand for it
for malting purposes. Hence an ounce of bullion of the
standard fineness destined for the smelting-pot of the artisan
is worth within a very trifle as much as an ounce of coined
money.</p>

<p>For example, by the law of the Bank of England an
ounce of standard gold (<sup><big>11</big></sup>&frasl;<sub><big>12</big></sub> fine) is coined into £3 17s.
10&#189;d., and the Bank is obliged to buy all bullion and foreign
coins of the standard fineness offered to it at £3 17s. 9d.
per ounce,&mdash;a difference of only three half-pennies. Now,
gold and silver are so indispensable in the form of money,
so beautiful in the form of ornaments, so well adapted to
serve the purposes of luxury and love of distinction, and
so really useful in the arts, that the Demand for them is
constant and well-nigh universal; and should there be in
the progress of civilization a lessened demand for them for
purposes of personal ornamentation and luxury, and a less
quantity be required for coins on account of the multiplied
use of cheques and other credit-forms, as seems likely in
both cases, a greater quantity will doubtless be required
for all the other uses old and new, and so, as the Demand
in the past has been steady, and probably steadily increasing,
there is every reason to expect the same course of
things for the time to come. Moreover, it contributes to
the steadiness in value of the gold and silver coin, that
there is at hand at all times, in the form of plate, a reservoir
from which a chance chasm in the coin may be replenished,
or an extra demand for it answered.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span></p>

<p>(b) On account of their tolerably uniform Cost of Production.
Not Desires only but Efforts as well determine
Value. Supply is the correlative of Demand; and when
to a steady demand there answers a steady supply realized
under conditions of pretty uniform difficulty, there will be
as a matter of course a pretty steady Value. Nature herself,
that is to say, God himself, has indicated in a manner not
to be mistaken the intention, that these precious metals
should be the Money of the nations. They are scattered
all over the earth, and so scattered that the cost of their
production has been on the whole pretty steady ever since
civilization and commerce began in earnest. God is a God
of order throughout all His works. Corresponding to the
nature and necessities of men is the whole structure of the
outward world. Science builds only on these predetermined
lines of Order. Induction is only possible where original
Resemblances run through great departments of phenomena.
To be enabled to buy and sell to any considerable
extent in order to meet their subjective wants, men must
have an objective measure of mutual Services, and this
measure must be a valuable steady in its purchasing-power:
very well; such a possible measure was all provided for
beforehand, when the foundations of the earth were laid.</p>

<p>The precious metals have always been obtained in one
or other of two ways: by surface diggings and washings,
and by rock-mining. Both were employed in the very
beginnings of Civilization. There is a description in the
book of Job (chapter xxviii) of the way in which the
ancient mines were wrought, and of the worth of the ores:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Truly there is a vein for silver,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a place for gold, which men refine.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Iron is obtained from earth,<br /></span>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Man putteth an end to darkness;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">For the stone of darkness and the shadow of death,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">They hang down, they swing away from men.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The earth, out of which cometh bread,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is torn up underneath, as it were by fire.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her stones are the place of sapphires,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">He bindeth up the streams, that they trickle not,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bringeth hidden things to light."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>These methods and difficulties in rock-mining, thus
poetically and beautifully delineated, have been substantially
the same from that early day to the present time;
and, consequently, there have been but two or three
striking changes in the general value of gold and silver
in the commercial world during the last 500 years, at least
changes owing to easier and larger Supply. The discovery
of the mines of Potosi in 1545, and the large influx of
silver into Europe from those and other American sources,
together with the irrational stimulus thereby given to the
working of European mines under the false impression
not even yet wholly dissipated that Value can be clutched
bodily in mining, so increased the stock of silver, that its
value as measured in grain or other commodities declined
in Europe in 70 years after 1570 to about 25% of its
previous purchasing-power. Adam Smith expresses the
opinion in his Wealth of Nations, that silver did not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
perceptibly fall before 1570, nor continue to fall further
after 1640. The discovery of gold deposits on the Pacific
coast of the United States in 1848, and a similar discovery
in Australia in 1851, enlarged the annual supply of gold
for the world from $40,000,000 in 1848 (<i>Chevalier</i>), to an
average of $136,000,000 for the five years ending in 1859
(<i>Jevons</i>); and the latter writer estimated the fall of gold
in general commodities from 1845 to 1862 at about 15%.
But with exceptions like these, and similar ones are perhaps
not likely to recur, the precious metals have always
maintained and seem likely to maintain in the future a
considerable uniformity of Value, as estimated by their
power to purchase other valuables, so far forth as Cost of
Production goes to determine their value. Even the great
changes just noted in the cost of the metals issued only
gradually in a rise of Prices, which many were able to
foresee and thus to provide for, but by which many more
were caught and brought into distress and even pauperism.
The two classes that suffer the most under a fall in the
Value of Money are the wages-receivers and the holders
of long annuities and other similar obligations.</p>

<p>(c) On account of their Quantity. The amount of
gold and silver in circulation in the commercial world, to
say nothing of the quantity so easily brought into circulation
from the reservoir of plate, is so vast, that it receives
the annual contributions from the mines much as the ocean
receives the waters of the rivers, without sensible increase
of its volume, and parts with the annual loss by detrition
and shipwreck, as the sea yields its waters to evaporation,
without sensible diminution of volume. The yearly
supply and the yearly waste are small in comparison with
the accumulations of ages; and, therefore, the relation of
the whole mass to the uses of the world, and the purchasing-power
of any given portion, remain comparatively
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>
steady. It is probable, that production at the mines might
cease altogether for a considerable interval without very
sensibly enhancing throughout the commercial world the
value of gold, as it is certain, from experience, that a
production very largely augmented only very gradually
and after a considerable interval of time diminishes its
value. The mass of the precious metals has been aptly
compared with the heavy balance-wheel in mechanics,
which preserves an equable and working condition of the
machinery under any sudden increase of the power, and
even when the power is for a moment withdrawn.</p>

<p>Just at this point a caution is needful. Because it is
affirmed that the great amount of the precious metals is
a ground of their firm value, it must not be supposed that
we are going beyond our general doctrine, and introducing
another element, namely, Quantity, besides the four elements,
which, as we have so often alleged, can alone vary
the value of any Service. Quantity, in itself, is not an
element capable of varying the value of anything, but
taken in connection with durability, it is an element of
what might, perhaps, be called with propriety the <i>Inertia</i>
of Value, and tends to keep the purchasing-power of gold
and silver where it is. <i>Value and Steadiness of Value are
two distinct ideas.</i> The present value of an ounce of gold
is decided by four things alone, two Desires and two
Efforts; but other elements besides these may help determine
that that ounce of gold shall have ten years from
now a purchasing-power approximately the same as now.
It will depend of course in the last analysis upon the
relation of the then Demand to the then Supply; yet the
vast quantity of the precious metals in existence, combined
with their durability, prevents those fluctuations in the
Supply which are so destructive to a steady value. It is not
with them as with the fruits and the cereals, whose value
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
varies perpetually with the seasons, and which are so
perishable that they must be sold quick or never. Gold
and silver are almost indestructible, and the existing mass
is not liable to be lessened except by wear and accident,
and in so far as the annual production from the mines
exceeds the yearly waste there is a natural provision made
for the natural increase of Demand to supply the wants
of the world for money and for the arts without much
disturbing the relation of the Demand and the Supply;
and so Quantity in connection with durability helps
preserve to them a tolerably steady value from generation
to generation.</p>

<p>(d) On account of their Fluency. Gold and silver are
in demand the world over. Having great value in comparatively
small bulk, they are easily transported from
Continent to Continent; and whenever from any cause
they become relatively in excess in any country, and so
lose there a portion of their previous purchasing-power,
there is an immediate motive in profits to export them to
other countries, in which their power in exchange is
greater, and thus the equilibrium tends to restore itself.
The proposition is, The value of gold and silver is kept
pretty steady throughout the commercial world by the
facility with which they are carried from points where
they are relatively in excess to points where they are relatively
in deficiency. In any country or place where the
precious metals are temporarily in excess, the prices of
general commodities as measured in them will rise of
necessity, because the unit of measure is smaller than it
was; and for the same general reason, the country temporarily
lacking in these will experience in consequence a
fall of general prices. There is, therefore, a private gain
in carrying these metals to those countries in which their
power of purchase is the greatest owing to the lack of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>
them, because more commodities can be obtained in exchange
for them than at home; and private motives here
coincide, as indeed they generally do, with public welfare,
since what the traders do in carrying gold and silver
abroad with an eye to their own interest only, helps maintain
at home and abroad the steady value of these commodities.</p>

<p>This law of the distribution of the precious metals by
Commerce, and the equilibrium of their general value
resulting therefrom, is as natural and beautiful as the law
which preserves the level of the ocean, or that which balances
the bodies of the planetary system. This has come
at length to be recognized by the nations, and the laws
which used to forbid by heavy penalties the exportation of
gold and silver are all swept away, and these metals are
now free to go and do actually go wherever they can
obtain the most in exchange. It is absurd to suppose that
their owners would carry them out of a country unless
they were worth more abroad than at home; and, therefore,
the prejudice which still exists in this country (the
relics of itself) is a senseless prejudice. The gold is not
given away, it is <i>sold</i>, and sold for more than it will buy
at home; otherwise nothing in the world could start on its
foreign travels. There is the same kind of gain in this as
in all other exchanges of commodities, with this great incidental
advantage in addition, that its general value is by
this means kept pretty uniform throughout the commercial
world.</p>

<p>Unluckily for the darker and middle Ages, so far as
they took their cue and thought from the Romans, the
latter, in the teeth of the sound view of Aristotle, looked
upon Money as something quite different from other forms
of salable things, looked upon it in short as an <i>end</i> in itself,
as something to be gained and not readily to be parted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span>
with. If this were the right view of Money, as it is not,
then the policy to spring from it might well be,&mdash;Get all
the money possible into the country, and let as little as
possible out! Just this came to be the policy of the
Romans. In one of his Orations, Cicero says, "<i>The Senate
solemnly decreed both many times previously, and again when
I was consul, that gold and silver ought not to be exported.</i>"
The other and the true opinion, that money is bought and
sold like any other valuable, and that its sole peculiar function
is as a <i>means</i> to further sales, was indeed held and
argued at Rome, as we learn incidentally from a passage in
the Institutes of Justinian; but the false though plausible
opinion, that money is <i>ultimate</i>, and not <i>mediate</i>, is said in
the same passage "to <i>have prevailed</i>"; and accordingly
this superficial view of money, and that it "<i>ought not to
be exported</i>," constitute what may be called the Bullion
Theory, and it is the first general theory of Sales ever
promulgated. The Romans brought it forth, and other
nations took it from them. It could never stand in the
light of Reason, and still less amid the exigencies of practical
Commerce.</p>

<p>It is an illustration of the continuity of human thinking
as well in wrong as in right directions, that the second main
theory of Sales, which has long been styled the Mercantile
Theory, is a prolongation and expansion of the first. <i>That</i>
gave an undue weight to gold and silver over other goods
in trade, and forbade their export: <i>this</i> did the same thing
too, but also tried to swell the exports of other goods
beyond the worth of current imports, <i>so as to get back a
balance in gold and silver</i>: both alike interfered with the
international fluency of the precious metals, to the constant
detriment of all parties to the restrictions. The
common principles of both Theories may be thus expressed:
<i>Gold and silver are the things to get; they are</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>
<i>worth more than what they will buy; therefore let us get all
of these in that we can, and let as little of them out as we
can; and let us work all our trade so, that others shall have
to give us a balance back in gold and silver.</i> These false
postulates and inferences wrought centuries of woe in the
world of commerce, because all the leading nations became
devotees simultaneously to this scheme of each shrewdly
plundering the rest. The germs of this Mercantile Theory
appear first in France, when Phillippe le Bel, in ordinances
of 1303 and 1304, put his hand in as king to mend the
movement of trade, to forbid the export of gold and silver,
to fix the price of wheat and to forbid its export, and to
lessen imports by prohibitions of them. "<i>Considering that
our enemies might profit by our provisions, and that it is
important to leave them their merchandise, we have ordered
that the former should not be exported nor the latter imported.</i>"
The famous Colbert, who laid down many financial
maxims that are good, thought nevertheless, that he
could so manage the foreign trade of France that she
should get the better of her neighbors, and embodied his
plan in the tariff of 1664. We will let him state his plan
in his own words: "<i>To reduce export duties on provisions
and manufactures of the Kingdom; to diminish import duties
on everything which is of use in manufactures; and to repel
the products of foreign manufactures by raising the duties.</i>"
The principle of the Mercantile Theory was never better
or briefer expressed than by Ustariz, a Spaniard, in 1740:
"<i>It is necessary rigorously to employ all the means that can
lead us to sell to foreigners more of our productions than
they will sell us of theirs, as that is the whole secret and the
sole advantage of trade.</i>" Too many nations knew the
"whole secret" at the same time, and accordingly the
"sole advantage" to any became exceedingly small. England
was as deep in the sloughs and wars and losses of
this false system as any of the rest.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span></p>

<p>It may be laid down as an axiom, that no country will
ever export for the sake of buying other things those
things which are more needful for its own welfare at
home. So long as human nature continues what it is,
what it always was, what it always will be, no persons in
any nation will ever export gold and silver except to buy
therewith other valuables then and there more important
to them and consequently to their country. There need
not be the slightest fear that any nation which cultivates
its own commercial advantages under freedom will ever
lack for a day a sufficient <i>quantum</i> of the precious metals;
because under freedom these metals will always go, and
go in just the right proportions, to and from those countries
which produce and offer in exchange those desirable
Services which other countries want. The greater the
enterprise and skill, the keener the development of all
peculiar and presently available resources, the more honorable
and free the commercial system, so much the surer is
any nation whether it be a gold-bearing country or not, of
securing all the gold and silver which it needs. This is
so, because <i>there</i> will be a good market to buy in, an abundance
of good and cheap goods will be there, and they who
have gold will resort thither to buy. But such a free and
enterprising nation will also want to buy other things
besides gold and silver, and other things than those itself
can make or grow to advantage, and when enough of the
precious metals is secured for money and the arts, the
residue will be exported, perhaps to the very countries
from which it originally came, in payment for some products
which <i>those</i> countries have an advantage in producing.</p>

<p>The United States, for example, is a gold- and silver-bearing
country, and exported in the years 1850-60, both
inclusive, $502,789,759 in coin and bullion, according to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>
the official Report on the Finances, 1863; and during the
same period imported from other countries $81,270,571 in
coin and bullion. Where was the famous and fallacious
"balance of trade" in that case? The United Kingdom,
on the other hand, is not a gold- and silver-producing
country at all, but it is the central market of the world for
the precious metals all the same, its imports and exports
of them are immense in all directions, because it is an
enterprising country within the lines of Nature in agriculture
and manufactures and commerce, and is not afraid to
allow its people to buy and sell freely with all the world.
Where lies in the technical sense the "balance of trade"
between Great Britain and the rest of the world? Who
can tell? All that is known, and all that is worth knowing,
is, that all that trade is immensely profitable to all
the parties to it wherever situated.</p>

<p>Now, there is always a double advantage in these free
movements of coin and bullion in exportation and importation.
In the first place, more and better commodities are
secured to the countries exporting, whether they be gold-bearing
or not, than the gold could have bought in those
countries, otherwise it would not have been carried abroad,
that being the sole motive that stirs it from its present
haunts; and in the second place, the benefit to the countries
importing is the market for their own commodities
created by the gold brought in, for we must never forget
that a market for products is products in market, is a benefit
also in naturally and easily filling up a chance deficiency
in the quantum of coin there, and incidentally too a benefit
to the world as tending to keep <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in equilibrio</i> the purchasing-power
of the metals everywhere. This last is
especially seen when new and pregnant sources of supply
are opened in any country. For example, in the United
States about the middle of the century the stock of gold
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span>
was more than doubled in ten years' time; unless by much
the larger part of this had been carried abroad in commerce,
it would have inevitably depreciated the whole
mass and disturbed the prices of everything; but by causing
the new gold to impinge on the whole world's stock, the
shock of the new production on the measure of Services,
though perceptible, was reduced and deadened. The
world's mass of the precious metals is comparatively torpid
beneath the action of an accretion which would break down
by its weight the metals of a single nation. Therefore, in
conclusion on this topic, the Fluency of gold and silver,
by which they pass easily in commerce to those places
where their present value in exchange is greatest, or to
such countries as India and China which have shown for
centuries a wonderful power to absorb the metals of the
West, and return as easily when the conditions are reversed,
or when a larger use of paper-credits releases some
portion of the coin, tends powerfully to make their general
value uniform throughout the world, and consequently to
make them the best medium of Exchange and the best
measure of Services.</p>

<p>(e) On account of this Circumstance, that every general
rise or fall in the value of gold and silver tends quickly to
check itself. This principle, indeed, is applicable more or
less to the value of all commodities, but owing to their
quantity and durability and fluency pre-eminently applicable
to the value of the precious metals. The check is
double in either direction. First, let us suppose that the
purchasing-power of an ounce of gold or silver be rising:
then, production will be stimulated at all the mines, and
the more stimulated as the rise is more; and this new
and enlarged Supply will tend to check a farther rise, and
unless the permanent Demand has been in the meantime
intensified, to bring back the value to the old point; moreover,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span>
when there is a rise in the value of the coin, a less
quantity is required to do the same amount of business;
and the demand for gold which causes the rise tends to be
checked by the rise itself, because a lessened quantity is
needed for money-use in consequence of the rise. If the
exchanges mediated by money have become permanently
greater than before, then of course the Demand will continue
greater than before, and the rise in value may be
maintained.</p>

<p>And just so, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mutatis mutandis</i>, of a fall in the purchasing-power
of the coin. The production of the metals is thereby
slackened at the mines, and the lessened Supply tends
naturally to enhance the value; and if the same amount of
business is to be done as before, there is a stronger demand
for money while the fall continues, and this new Demand
helps also to bring back the old value. All this is in the
interest of a steady value.</p>

<p>(f) On account, lastly, of this Circumstance, that a
stronger Demand for Money is met in either one of two
ways, by increasing the stock of coin, or by an increased
rapidity of circulation of that on hand. It is exceedingly
fortunate that a brisker demand for money, especially if it
be but temporary, does not necessarily enlarge the Supply
or alter the value, but only hurries round the existing
money. Oscillations in the Demand are responded to by a
slower or a more rapid circulation. This tends admirably to
keep the value of the existing-stock of money steady within
certain limits. Ignorance of this principle, or indifference
to it, has caused mighty mischiefs in the United States.
In General Grant's administration, for instance, the cry that
a larger <i>volume</i> of money was needed "<i>to move the crops</i>" was
disastrous in its results. The truth is, that the volume of
Money in the United States was then, and has been ever
since, by much too great, considering its character, as we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span>
shall see by and by. The multiplying and fructifying
nature of Rapidity of Circulation has never been understood
by our national financiers. When, however, enterprises
are multiplying and Exchanges are being permanently
increased in number and variety, then there must be a larger
volume of money, and this larger amount is secured in the
ways already indicated, with perhaps slight disturbances of
value, but the temporary ebbs and flows of business should
have no effect at all on the mass of money, but only on its
movement, and its value consequently would scarcely be
disturbed.</p>

<p>These Six grounds appear to be satisfactory and sufficient
to account for the superior steadiness of the value of gold
and silver, so far as their value is determined by considerations
relating to these metals themselves. We now
proceed to the two reasons additional to this why gold and
silver constitute the best Money.</p>

<p>(2) The second general reason why gold and silver
make the best money is found in the fact <i>that Governments
have little to say or do about the Value and Quantity and
Mode of Circulation of such Money</i>. In respect to Credit-Moneys,
like our own Greenbacks and national Bank-Bills,
the Government has everything to say. When we remember
how governments are constituted, that they are
only a transient Committee of the citizens for special
purposes; of what sort of persons they commonly consist;
the variety of subjects they are obliged to consider during
short periods of office; the absence for the most part of
expert knowledge among them; the enormous blunders
they have made in the past in all financial measures; and
that those who know the most about their action in the
past and present in such matters have the least confidence
in their ability to act wisely; the better we shall see the
strength of the grounds of this second reason. In all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>
essential respects money of gold and silver regulates itself.
These metals came to be money and continue to be money
in the main sense independent of the enactments of any
Government. The people chose them: they choose them
still. As we have seen, coins do not owe their value to the
stamp of the Government, since the metal in them is worth
within a trifle as much before coinage as after. Coinage
publicly attests the quantity and quality of the metal in
the coin, and that is all. Of the value of their coins governments
say nothing. They can say nothing. That depends
on men's judgments, and not on edicts at all. No law of
the United States can add directly an appreciable fraction
to the value of a gold dollar. The law makes it consist of
25<sup><big>4</big></sup>&frasl;<sub><big>5</big></sub> grains troy
of gold <sup><big>9</big></sup>&frasl;<sub><big>10</big></sub> fine, the mint so stamps and
attests it, and thereafter it takes its own chance as to value.</p>

<p>Some Governments charge a little something for coining
for their People, and some do not. What is charged is
called <i>seignorage</i>. England coins gold for all comers at a
seignorage of .032%, which is practically a free coinage.
France charges for gold .216%; and by the law of 1874,
the United States charge nothing for coining gold. It is
left to the People to say <i>how much</i> money they will have
coined; and, having received it back from the mint, they
may do just what they please with it; they may hoard it,
they may melt it, they may sell it at home in purchase, and
they may export it in foreign trade, at will. Now, it is a
great gain, an immense relief, to have a Money with which
the Government has nothing to do except to mint it; a
money that asks no favors, needs no puffing, never deceives
anybody, knows how to take care of itself, is always
respectable and everywhere respected.</p>

<p>(3) The last general reason why gold and silver make
the best Money is to be found in their physical peculiarities,
in accordance with which they are (a) <i>uniform in</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span>
<i>quality</i>, (b) <i>conveniently portable</i>, (c) <i>divisible without loss</i>,
(d) <i>easily impressible</i>, and (e) <i>always beautiful</i>.</p>

<p>Pure gold and pure silver, no matter where they are
mined, are exactly of the same <i>quality</i> all over the earth.
Not so with iron and coal and copper. Gold is gold, and
silver is silver. The gold mined to-day in California differs
in no essential respect from the gold used by Solomon
in the construction of the Temple, and the silver out of
the Nevada mines is the same thing as the silver paid by
Abraham for the cave of Machpelah. Nature with her
wise finger has thus stamped them for the universal money;
and a universal coinage, that is, coins of the same degree
of fineness, and brought into easy numerical relations with
each other in respect to weight, and current everywhere
by virtue of universal confidence in them, though bearing
the symbols preferred by the nation that mints them, is
one of the dreams and hopes of economists, that will be
realized in some</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">"Fair future day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which Fate shall brightly gild."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Gold and silver are sufficiently <i>portable</i> for all the purposes
of modern Money. Their weight is little relatively
to their value. A thousand dollars in gold are not indeed
carried so easily as a Bill of Exchange or a Bank-note;
and expedients are easily adopted, and have been in use
since the days of the Romans (really since the later days
of the Assyrians), by which the transfer in place of large
masses of coin is for the most part obviated; and these
expedients have all been explained at length in the foregoing
chapter on Commercial Credits. But for the ordinary
exchanges for which they are designed, gold and
silver coins are portable enough. The writer has carried
across the ocean, incased in a glove-finger and borne in a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span>
vest-pocket, a troy pound of English sovereigns, worth
about $230, scarcely conscious of their weight though easily
reassured of their presence by a touch of the hand. The
experience of those countries, like France and Germany,
in which the Money has been and is still mostly metallic,
has not pronounced it onerous on account of its weight;
and, at any rate, it is better to accept all the other immense
advantages of gold and silver money, together with some
inconvenience as to weight, if one chooses to insist on
that, than to adopt substitutes every way inferior as money,
except that they are lighter in our purses. They are unfortunately
"lighter" in other respects also.</p>

<p>Moreover, gold and silver differ from jewels and most
other precious things, in that they are <i>divisible</i> without any
loss of value into pieces of any required size. The aggregate
of pieces is worth as much as the mass and the mass
as much as the pieces. This is a great advantage in
Money, because for the convenience of business a considerable
variety of coins is required, and the proper proportion
of each kind to the rest is a matter of trial, and if any
kind be minted in excess of the demand nothing more is
required than to remint in other denominations, and the
whole value is thus saved to the country in the most convenient
form.</p>

<p>Then, gold and silver are easily <i>impressible</i> by any stamp
which the Government chooses to put upon them. Indeed
in their natural state they are too soft to retain long the
impress of the die. Accordingly for coinage purposes they
are always alloyed with another metal, chiefly copper,
since by a chemical law whenever two such metals are
mixed together the compound is harder than either of the
two ingredients. Most of the Nations now use in their
gold and silver coins <sup><big>1</big></sup>&frasl;<sub><big>10</big></sub> alloy, but England still adheres to
her ancient rule of <sup><big>1</big></sup>&frasl;<sub><big>12</big></sub> only. So compounded coins receive
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span>
readily and retain for a long time with sharp distinctness
the legend and other devices chosen for them to bear. In
monarchical countries the head of the reigning sovereign
is usually stamped upon the current coins; in all countries
national emblems of some sort; quite recently some of the
coins of the United States have been made to bear the
appropriate legend "In God we trust"; so that patriotic
and even religious associations are connected with the
national Money. Although the alloys harden the coins,
yet after long usage they will lose a part of their weight
by abrasion, and Governments usually indicate a short
weight, after coming to which the coins are no longer a
legal tender for debts. Thus an English sovereign weighs
5 pennyweights 3&nbsp;<sup><big>171</big></sup>&frasl;<sub><big>623</big></sub>
grains, containing 113&nbsp;<sup><big>1</big></sup>&frasl;<sub><big>623</big></sub> grains of
fine gold, and when it falls below 5 pennyweights 2&#190; grains,
it loses its legal-tender character.</p>

<p>Lastly, gold and silver when coined into Money are
objects of great <i>beauty</i>. This is no slight recommendation
of these metals for the money of the world. They are
clean. They are beautiful. People like to see them, and
to handle them, and to have them. Their perfectly circular
form, the device covering the whole piece, the milled
and fluted edges, the patriotic emblem, whatever it be, the
religious or other legend, and their bright color, are all
elements in their beauty. The educating power over the
young of a good coinage well kept up, æsthetically, historically,
and commercially, is a matter of consequence to
any country. A whole people handling constantly such
money cannot fail to receive a wholesome development
thereby. The new German coinage, for example, in contrast
with the old moneys of the German States, furnishes
a good illustration of all this. The new German coins
from highest to lowest are very beautiful, and have already
tended and will tend more and more, other things
being equal, to a true German nationality.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span></p>

<p>11. Silver is much inferior to gold as a metal for
Money, for this main reason, that it has proved itself much
less steady in its general <i>value</i>; and its value is less
steady, because it is subject to greater changes in its Supply
and greater variations in its Demand. As an example
touching Supply, we cite the fact, that the annual silver
product of the world <i>doubled</i> in the third quarter of this
Century, rising from an average of $40,000,000 yearly,
1851-61, to $80,000,000 in 1875; and that Nevada alone
yielded in 1876 as much as the whole world yielded
twenty years before. Then, too, Demand, that is, effective
public opinion, does not hold to silver as it does to gold
for a standard of Values. The action of England in 1816,
of the United States in 1853, of Germany in 1871, of
Scandinavia in 1874, and of the Latin Union in 1876, <i>in
legally making gold the sole standard of Services and silver
subsidiary to that</i>, of course affected more or less the
Demand for silver as Money, and thus varied its value.
We have at hand the data to demonstrate the effect of
these two causes combined: the average price of silver in
gold from 1833 to 1874, in the London market, which is
the bullion market of the world, was for the 40 years just
about 60 pence per ounce, never falling below 58&#189; and
never rising to 63. At 60 pence per ounce (444 grains
of pure silver, standard English silver being .925 fine) the
ratio of gold to silver is 1:15.716. But between May,
1875, and July, 1876, when both the above causes had come
into full action, silver dropped in the London market to
47 pence per ounce, a fall of 21%, and a ratio of gold to
silver of 1:20. The price gradually rose again to about
53 pence per ounce, and remained in that general neighborhood
till 1882, between which date and 1890 the <i>sagging</i>
process went on to the general result of 25% discount
as compared with the old average of 60 pence in gold per
ounce of silver.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span></p>

<p>These facts settle the question adversely to the fitness
of silver to become an independent Measure of Values.
When, however, it is designed that gold and silver shall
circulate together in some numerical relation to each
other as Money, it becomes needful that Government shall
fix as well as it can, not the general value of either but
the relative value each in each for the time being. But
this specific value, too, goes on to regulate itself independently
of government edicts. No matter how well the
work is done at first by ascertaining the actual ratio in
which they are exchanging in a free market, it will certainly
require revision from time to time. This is what is
called <i>Bimetallism</i>. The reader will now perceive the fundamental
and ineradicable difficulty with the bimetallic
system, which has led by bitter experience nearly all the
European nations to abandon it. It especially becomes us
to understand how the United States have fared in a century's
attempt to keep <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in equilibrio</i> as a conjoint and legal
Measure of Services both gold and silver in a fixed numerical
relation.</p>

<p>Alexander Hamilton as the first Secretary of the National
Treasury, entering upon excellent preparatory work
done both by Robert Morris and Thomas Jefferson, guided
the action of Congress in establishing the Mint in 1792,
and really determined the weight and fineness of the first
federal coins and their relative value each in each, the
silver coins being struck in 1794 and the gold ones in
1795. The silver dollar was copied from the Spanish
milled dollar of commerce, which contained 371.25 grains
of pure silver, and that has been the exact content of our
national silver dollar from that day to this. The halves
and quarters and dimes were exactly proportioned in
weight and fineness to their units. Hamilton supposed
that gold was then worth in Europe 15 times as much as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span>
silver, and advised consequently that the gold dollar
should contain 24.75 grains pure, and that both dollars
should be alloyed at the English rate of <sup><big>1</big></sup>&frasl;<sub><big>12</big></sub>, thus making
the silver dollar weigh 405 grains and the gold dollar 27
grains; but Congress, while enacting the gold dollar just
as the Secretary recommended, preferred to <i>alloy</i> the silver
dollar by 44.75 grains instead of 33.75, thus making its
weight 416 grains. Alloy is of no account in value.</p>

<p>From the ratio of 1:15 fixed by the act of Congress in
accord with Hamilton's opinion as to the relative value of
gold in silver to be maintained in the coins, unforeseen
and important consequences followed, since that was not
the true ratio of their value at the time in the markets of
the world; an ounce of gold was worth more at that time
than 15 ounces of silver, and, accordingly, was worth
more out of the coinage than in it, and was therefore
exported in preference to silver in payment of foreign
balances, especially after France had changed the relative
legal value to 1:15&#189;, which happened in 1803; and of
course the gold refused to circulate here under those
circumstances, being <i>undervalued</i> in the coinage, thus
giving a neat illustration of the economical law to be
unfolded under the next numerical heading, namely, that
the cheaper money will always push the dearer out of the
circulation. Not till 1834 was the attention of Congress
so strongly drawn to this fact and consequence, as to
secure an enactment to remedy it; and this coinage law
of 1834 rated gold to silver as 1:15.98. The weight of
the gold dollar was at the same time reduced from 27 to
25.8 grains, and the alloy increased from <sup><big>1</big></sup>&frasl;<sub><big>12</big></sub>
to <sup><big>1</big></sup>&frasl;<sub><big>10</big></sub>. These
changes of 1834 increased the relative legal valuation of
gold in silver 6.53%. But this in turn was going too far
in the opposite direction; gold was not worth 1:15.98 in
the bullion markets of Europe; France was holding steady
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span>
her ratio of 1:15.50; and, consequently, the commercial
current of the metals was now reversed, silver passing in
preference to Europe to liquidate the balances of trade,
and gold beginning to come to the United States, where
it would buy more than 3% more silver than in Europe.</p>

<p>Three years after the above changes, that is, in 1837,
the standard of <sup><big>9</big></sup>&frasl;<sub><big>10</big></sub>
fine instead of <sup><big>11</big></sup>&frasl;<sub><big>12</big></sub> was applied by law to
silver also, and this altered fineness made a change in the
weight of the silver coins necessary, if the ratio of 1:15.98
was to be maintained between the gold and silver.
Accordingly, the weight of the silver dollar, and of two
halves, four quarters, and so on, was reduced from 416
grains to 412&#189;, that is to say, less alloy was put into the
silver coins, but the fine silver to the dollar was kept just
as it was, namely, 371.25 grains. Since 1834 there has
been no change in the gold dollar and its multiples, and
since 1837 there has been no change in the silver <i>dollar-piece</i>,
and the legal ratio of value between gold and silver
in our coins is still 1:15.98, since the silver dollar of 1878
and onwards to 1890 corresponds in weight and fineness
with the dollar of 1837.</p>

<p>Still, notwithstanding the pains taken and the changes
made from time to time to keep the two metals in legal
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">equilibrio</i>, there never has been any considerable period
in the century now drawing to a close, during which gold
dollars and silver dollars have circulated freely and indifferently
in the United States. Sometimes it has been
the one kind, and sometimes the other kind, but never
both kinds at the same time. The present writing is in
the spring-time of 1890: both kinds of dollars are legal
tender for all debts public and private in the old-time
ratio; the national Government professes to be indifferent
whether it pay out gold or silver in redemption of its
paper-moneys, but after all, with the exception of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span>
Pacific States and a few special branches of business in
the cities of the East and of the Middle, gold coins are not
now in common circulation, the bank drawers crowded
with silver dollars feel little of the weight and see little
of the shine of the gold coins, and if any of these chance
to be paid out to ordinary bank-customers they are pretty
certain to return in speedy deposit. The theoretical
bimetallism of the United States has been a practical
though alternate monometallism with various incidental
and concurrent disadvantages and losses.</p>

<p>By 1853 these disadvantages of a long-attempted double
Measure of Services made legal tender for all debts had
become plain enough to everybody, for experience had
demonstrated that the Value of gold and silver each in
each was not constant but constantly variable; and Congress
then wisely determined to make Gold alone the
legal tender, except in sums below $5. In connection
with this great change in the coinage, a lesser one was
introduced at the same time, namely, to reduce the weight
of the silver half-dollar and its subdivisions, so that their
nominal value in the coinage should be considerably above
their metallic value, and their exportations be thus prevented.
Accordingly, the half-dollar was reduced in
weight from 206&#188; to 192 grains, and the smaller coins
proportionally. This was in imitation of the English
legislation of 1816, and brought into this country a <i>subsidiary</i>
silver coinage, which still continues, and of which
a nominal dollar's worth weighed 6.91% less than the
Silver Dollar, which was not mentioned one way or the
other in the law of 1853, but which was then worth about
three cents more than the gold dollar, and was of course
wholly out of circulation.</p>

<p>Through the influence of the late Samuel B. Ruggles,
these subsidiary silver coins were brought in 1875 into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span>
harmony with the silver-system of France and the Latin
Union. Their five-franc silver piece which is also <sup><big>9</big></sup>&frasl;<sub><big>10</big></sub> fine,
weighs just 25 <i>grams</i> or 385.8 <i>grains</i>; a dollar's worth of
our subsidiary silver, as we have just seen, weighed 384
grains; and it was, therefore, needful to add only a slight
fraction of weight to our smaller silver coins in order to
knit a real connection between them and much of the
European silver. Two halves, four quarters, ten dimes of
our silver since 1875, are debased in weight (not in fineness)
6.47% as compared with the standard silver dollar.
A more important coinage connection with Europe was
knit through our first five-cent nickel pieces, each of which
weighs just five <i>grams</i>, and five of which laid along in order
measure exactly a <i>decimetre</i> in length. These were the
first official applications of the Metric System on the part
of the United States. The nickel pieces, both the five-cent
and the three-cent, are 75 parts copper and 25 parts
nickel; and the one-cent piece is 95 parts copper and 5
parts tin-zinc. Debts of 4 cents can be legally paid in one-cent
pieces, of 60 cents in three-cent pieces, of 100 cents
in five-cent pieces, of 500 cents in <i>subsidiary</i> silver, and of
any amount in gold coins or in silver <i>dollars</i>.</p>

<p>12. <i>A money inferior in general value will, so long as it
circulates locally, drive a superior money out of the circulation.</i>
This proposition is a fundamental and universal one
in monetary Science. The only exception to it is found in
<i>token-coins</i>, and in subsidiary silver so far as that has the
<i>token</i>-quality, that is, so far as its <i>nominal</i> is above its <i>bullion</i>
Value. The main motive in coining tokens is to make sure
for its own local uses of a nation's small change. Token-money
is worthless for export, is only designed for the
smaller exchanges, is legal tender only for very small sums,
and is acceptable only on local and conventional grounds.
The exception aside, the above proposition is a pervading
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span>
and controlling Law of Finance and has been illustrated
over and over again in every Age and Nation. It is as
solid as the substance of truth can make it, although it
looks at first sight like a paradox. We naturally think
that what is excellent all round tends rather to displace
what is inferior in spots, but with Money the exact reverse
is the law; and the perfect coin of full weight, instead of
driving out the light and the debased pieces, is always
itself driven out of the circulation by them.</p>

<p>The reason for this becomes obvious the moment we
ponder the nature of Money. Money is always a Valuable,
taking on in addition under Law or Custom the function
of serving as an instrument of Exchange. As money,
nobody wants it except to buy with, and so long as the
Government and the community treat light coin and full
coin as of equal value, receiving them indifferently in payment
of debts and of taxes, it is clear that nobody will
give in payment of debts and of taxes that which is really
worth more so long as that which is really worth less will
go just as far. The inferior pieces will abide in a market
where they will fetch just as much as the superior pieces,
while the superior pieces will take on a form or migrate to
a place in which some advantage can be gained from their
superiority. Thrown into the crucible, or exported in
commerce, this superiority immediately manifests itself;
and therefore into the crucible or into the channels of
foreign trade it might be confidently predicted beforehand
that such money would be thrown, and all experience testifies
with one voice that exactly those are the destinations
of such money.</p>

<p>Aristophanes, the Greek comic poet, in the 5th century
before Christ, seems to have been the first writer who
noticed that good coins of full weight are apt to be
crowded out of the circulation by the lighter and poorer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span>
pieces, and he, mistaking the cause of this, satirized his
countrymen unmercifully for preferring bad coins to good,
and demagogues, like Cleon, to honorable citizens for
rulers. The following are the verses:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Oftentimes have we reflected on a similar abuse,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the choice of men for office, and of coins for common use;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For your old and standard pieces, valued and approved and tried,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here among the Grecian nations, and in all the world beside,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Recognised in every realm for trusty stamp and pure assay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are rejected and abandoned for the trash of yesterday;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For a vile, adulterate issue, drossy, counterfeit, and base,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which the traffic of the city passes current in their place!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the men that stood for office, noted for acknowledged worth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And for manly deeds of honor, and for honorable birth;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Trained in exercise and art, in sacred dances and in song,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All are ousted and supplanted by a base, ignoble throng;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Paltry stamp and vulgar metal raise them to command and place,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brazen counterfeit pretenders, scoundrels of a scoundrel race,<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>Sir Thomas Gresham, financier of Queen Elizabeth and
founder of the Royal Exchange and of Gresham College
in London, was the first thinker to understand fully and
explain scientifically what Aristophanes and others had
noticed as a fact, and what in its explanation may hence
properly be called "<i>Gresham's Law</i>." We will append a
few historical illustrations of the fact and the law as
instructive in many ways.</p>

<p>(a) The City of Amsterdam founded its famous Bank
in 1609, because no other way seemed to open of preventing
the clipped and worn foreign coins then and for a
long time circulating in that great Mart of Trade from
driving out completely the good money of full weight,
which the Mint of the City had been constantly pouring
in. The Bank was devised as a municipal Institution with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span>
this intent; it was a Bank of Deposit only; it took in all
the old coins at their <i>bullion</i> value only; and then had them
reminted at full weight; it gave the depositors credit on
its books in the terms of the <i>new</i> money for all of the <i>old</i>
they chose to bring in; it then adjusted accounts between
merchants and all other of its customers by mere transfers
on its books; the City required all debts falling due in
Amsterdam to be paid in the new "bank-money," which
took away all uncertainty from Bills of Exchange drawn
on Amsterdam, which were previously liable to be paid in
the clipped and worn coin, and were therefore sometimes
at as much as 10% discount in other cities; this simple
requirement brought these foreign bills to par, and kept
them there; the full-weighted money now stamped by the
city Mint abode in the circulation, being now the sole
Measure of Services there; and thus it became the interest
and convenience of every business man in Amsterdam to
have these simple dealings with the Bank, which in turn
enjoyed unlimited credit in the commercial world for almost
two hundred years.</p>

<p>(b) The great English Recoinage of 1696 was completed
under the imperatives of Gresham's Law. Graphically does
Macaulay describe the causes and the effects of this in his
21st Chapter. The old silver coins had been stamped under
the hammer; few of them were perfectly circular; the edges
were neither milled nor fluted; the legend was not so near
the edge as that the letters were impaired by a little
clipping; it was easy to pare off a pennyworth or two, and
then pass the coins along; it was profitable to do it, and in
vain that Elizabeth enacted that the clipper must suffer the
penalties of high treason; nearly all the coin of the realm
became mutilated, and about 1660 a new process of coinage
was brought in. A mill worked by horses fabricated the
new coins on better principles. They were exactly round,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span>
and the edges were inscribed with a legend, and they were
all of just and equal weight. They were thrown out to
pass current with the hammered money, and it seems to
have been expected that they would soon come to displace
it. But they did not. Both were received at first without
distinction by the individual traders and by the public tax-gatherers.
But the milled money soon came to be scarce,
and the old money grew constantly worse. The lighter the
old coins became, the scarcer became the new ones; for
who would pay two ounces of silver when one ounce was
legal tender? The new money was melted, was exported,
was hoarded, but circulate it would not. At length the
lightest pieces began to be refused by some people, and
other people demanded that their silver should be paid to
them by weight and not by tale, and there was wrangling
over every counter, and a dispute at every settlement, and
the coin was really so diverse in its value that there was
no longer any measure of value in the kingdom; business
was in utmost confusion, society was by the ears, poor
people were unmercifully fleeced, and shrewd ones grew
enormously rich; and the Jacobites secretly exulted in the
hope of being able to avail themselves of the prevailing
discontent to overthrow the scarcely established revolutionary
government of William and Mary; when, by the joint
counsels of two such philosophers as Locke and Newton,
and two such statesmen as Somers and Montague, the
government took the bold resolution of recoining all the
silver of the kingdom. An early day was fixed by Parliament
after which no clipped money could pass except in
payments to Government, and a later day after which it
could not pass at all.</p>

<p>(c) Gresham's Law has had beautiful illustrations in the
monetary history of the United States. We have already
seen the reason why the first silver dollars of 1794 could
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span>
not compete in currency with the gold coins of 1795,&mdash;the
silver was under-valued in the legal ratio 1:15,&mdash;it
would have been much nearer the European market at
1:15.5. There was another reason operative in the same
direction from the beginning, which did not, however, come
to the notice of the Government till ten years later. Only
321 silver dollar-pieces were coined in the year 1805; and
May 1, 1806, there stands an order from President Jefferson
to the Director of the Mint,&mdash;"<i>that all the silver to be
coined at the Mint shall be of small denominations, so that
the value of the largest pieces shall not exceed half a dollar</i>."
The presidential reason given for this order is,&mdash;"<i>that considerable
purchases have been made of dollars coined at the
Mint for the purpose of exporting them, and that it is probable
that further purchases and exportations will be made</i>." The
coinage of silver dollars thus suspended was not resumed
for 30 years. What was the matter with these dollars?
Nothing, only they were too valuable. Hamilton had
adopted for his new dollar the exact weight in fine silver
of the normal Spanish-Mexican dollar, then and for a long
time the unit of the thriving West India commerce; clipped
and worn coins of this popular stamp had slipped into circulation
in large numbers throughout the United States,
and driven out the new and good pieces in accordance with
a principle much better understood now than then; the
President's order itself was not very intelligent, inasmuch
as two halves, four quarters, or ten dimes, were then equal
in weight and purity with the dollar-pieces, and as a matter
of fact were almost (if not quite) equally driven out by
the smaller Spanish-Mexican coins. The "four-pences"
and "nine-pences" ("York shilling") of that coinage were
almost exclusively the small change of New York and
New England during the first half of this century. The
"dimes" and "half-dimes" of our own mintage, though
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span>
long legalized, were but slowly naturalized. The coin-changes
of 1853, already described, gave a fair chance for
the first time to our smaller silver coins.</p>

<p>The last native illustration of Gresham's Law will force
us to anticipate here the discussion under the next numerical
heading, so far as to assume that there is such a thing
as paper money, and that the Law now in hand works in
connection with that as well as with diverse forms of
metallic money. In 1862, Treasury notes, commonly called
Greenbacks, made a legal tender for debts though not bearing
interest, were issued by the national Government to
the amount of $450,000,000. Of course, under these circumstances
they depreciated in value as compared with the
gold dollars, which gold dollars <i>they were unfulfilled promises
to pay</i>. Just so soon as the greenback dollars fell fairly
below the gold dollars in value, the latter left the channels
of trade in a very few days' time. Down sank the greenbacks
gradually below the <i>subsidiary</i> silver coins in value,
and the latter obediently and utterly abandoned the commercial
field. At last the greenbacks went down even
below the level of the copper cents, which at that time cost
the government about half a cent each, and this invariable
law of money swept the circulation bare of coppers, and
the people had to resort for their smallest change to postage-stamps
and shin-plasters and other abominations. Happily,
the country survived to see these processes exactly reversed,
and the old law confirmed on its other side. When, after
a considerable interval, the paper dollar appreciated to the
proper height, it was interesting to watch the copper cents
put in a prompt re-appearance; after a still larger appreciation
of the paper, back came in abundance the subsidiary
silver; and as the day of the redemption of the paper drew
near, silver dollars and gold dollars greeted smilingly their
old acquaintances of the street.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[426]</a></span></p>

<p>13. So far we have treated only of Coin-Money in its
two forms, <i>substantive</i> and <i>subsidiary</i>. The latter may now
be dismissed as of little consequence in itself, and as
already elucidated fully: the latter is the only Money that
stands in its own right as a <i>commodity</i>, and the only Money
that can give birth to the <i>Denominations</i> of Value, such as
sovereigns, dollars, marks, and francs. <i>What is a Dollar?</i>
A dollar is 25<sup><big>4</big></sup>&frasl;<sub><big>5</big></sub> grains of a metal compound coined, of
which nine parts are pure gold and one part a hardening
alloy. It is a definite <i>quantity</i> of a thing definitely and
legally described. It is a visible and tangible and well-known
<i>commodity</i>. Government is competent, if it pleases,
to alter the quantity of gold that shall constitute a dollar,
although the People will quickly and roughly readjust the
prices of Services to a changed measure of them; it is
competent even to make a dollar out of silver, as our Government
has tried to do (for the most part vainly) for a
century, though it is <i>not</i> competent to cause both dollars
to circulate as such at the same time; but civilized and
advanced Governments are not practically competent to
make a Dollar out of anything else than gold and silver.</p>

<p>Money is a current and legal Measure of Services; for
the end and in the way in which Money alone originates
and becomes current its material must be a valuable commodity;
and after centuries of experiments and exclusions
no civilized People now tolerate any other commodity in
this relation than gold or silver. Such a selected commodity
becoming in the manner already explained an
actual medium passing from hand to hand in Exchanges,
impresses its <i>name</i> on the minds of men as an ideal <i>measure</i>
of services, which measure they can use, and do constantly
use, without handling at the time the commodity itself.
But these ideal-dollars, these denomination-dollars, need to
be kept in check by a constant recurrence to actual, palpable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span>
thing-dollars. The denomination only comes into
existence in connection with the use of the thing, cannot
possibly exist independently of it, and needs constantly to
be reduced to it (as it were by actual contact) in order to
be useful as a measure. Just as men talk about inches,
and calculate by inches, in thousands of cases in which no
actual inch is used as a measure, and in every case of
doubt, dispute, or difficulty have recourse to the actual
inch, and thus the ideal inch is kept steady in the minds
of men by frequent reference to the outward standard; so
the mental measure of services, which men insensibly
acquire from the use of the objective measure, needs to be
kept true by actual and frequent contact with that measure.</p>

<p>But besides this Thing-Dollar and its Denomination,
which always go together like a man and his shadow, there
is one other kind of Money, namely, the Promise-Dollar.
We must now attend to this. What is a Dollar-Bill?
How does it read? It is always a Promise of some Issuer
to pay to bearer One Dollar, that is to say, this legal and
definite quantity of a precious metal. There is no mystery
here. There can be none. A Dollar is a tangible and
weighable commodity. A Dollar-Bill is a Promise to
render this commodity to bearer on demand. The difference
is the same in kind as that between a bushel of corn
and a man's promise to his poor neighbor to give him a
bushel if he will come for it. It depends on the <i>man</i>, on
his ability and character, how much the corn-promise is
worth; and so it depends on the <i>issuer</i>, on his ability and
character, how much the coin-promise is worth. The Issuer
may be of such standing as to be able to secure for his
promises that they become "a current and legal measure
of Services"; and if so, they become Money under the
definition.</p>

<p>There is, then, such a thing as Paper-Money, though
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span>
many high authorities are reluctant to concede, that any
mere promises can be money at all. For ourselves we
cannot refuse the courtesy of the term "money" to paper-promises-to-pay-coin,
which our Country makes a legal
tender for all debts, public and private. The making
them legal tender, however, does not alter their nature
one particle. They are still promises,&mdash;and nothing more.
Their <i>Value</i> depends in all cases upon the character and
resources of the Issuer; their <i>Currency</i> may be quickened
(at some rate of value) by their being made a legal tender.
Nothing can by any possibility become a Money unless it
first be a Valuable. The essential characteristic of Money
is its possession of a <i>generalized</i> purchasing-power. The
Value of a promise depends on one set of causes, with
which we are now very familiar,&mdash;the same causes on
which the value of everything depends; the Generalization
of any purchasing-power into money depends upon another
set of causes, of which the action of a Government in
legislation may be one.</p>

<p>Paper-Money, as now defined, may be issued by Banks
with or without an indirect government sanction, or
through the direct action of Government. The Bank of
England has been issuing since 1694 paper-money under
a series of Charters granted by the Government, which
becomes thereby in a manner responsible to the bearers
for the redemption, that is, the fulfilment, of the direct
promises of "The Governor and Company of the Bank of
England"; since 1863 the so-called National Banks of the
United States have issued promises-to-pay, designed to
circulate as money, under the direct authority and quasi-endorsement
of the national Government; and since 1862
that Government has been putting out directly its own
promises commonly called "greenbacks." These last have
rested and now rest for their value solely on the good faith
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[429]</a></span>
of the People as between themselves. By a separate and
additional act of legislation, which it is mischievous as
well as unscientific to confound with the original promise-legislation,
this particular paper-money was and is legal
tender for debts, which collateral circumstance whether
wise or unwise neither changes the nature nor lessens the
obligation of the original promise to pay coin. No so-called
Decision of the Supreme Court can abolish or abridge a
natural and scientific distinction. Money is at bottom of
two kinds only: the first kind is an intermediate and
equivalent merchandise, <span class="smcap">Coin</span>; and the second kind is
Promises to pay this to a bearer on demand, <span class="smcap">Paper
Money</span>.</p>

<p>The only way to make any promise respectable is to
fulfil it in due time. The only way to make Paper Money
a decency is to hold sacred in action the promise that
distends it. The United States undertook in 1862 and
onwards to make its own plain promises respectable by a
different method, namely, by legally asserting in substance
that the <i>promise</i> is its own <i>fulfilment</i>, and needs no other;
and in this persistent undertaking encountered a miserable
failure throughout; because the People also persisted in
<i>estimating</i> the promise solely in the light of the <i>prospect</i>
of its literal fulfilment. The greenbacks at one time lost
two-thirds of their normal value under the working of
such estimation. This question of the relation of two
kinds of Money to each other is a question of Economics,
and not of Constitutional Law; or rather, it is a question
of common sense and common honesty, and the judgment
upon it of nine men learned in the Law is no whit better
than the judgment of nine other intelligent men.</p>

<p>As Money is analyzable into two varieties only, Coin
and Paper, so Paper Money falls into two classes, Convertible
and Inconvertible. A convertible paper money
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[430]</a></span>
consists of promises that are always <i>kept</i> by the issuer
according to their terms, that is to say, that are paid in
specie at the will of the holder. An inconvertible paper
money is only another name for unfulfilled promises. Is
it any wonder that unfulfilled promises to pay invariably
become less valuable than <i>that</i> which they promise to pay?
They are valuable to start with, else they could not become
money, and they are valuable because men suppose
the promise will be kept: they are commonly valueless to
end with, because men lose faith in the fulfilment of a
promise long delayed. This is the simple secret of the
depreciation of inconvertible money so soon as the amount
of it passes a certain limit, and so soon as a certain time
has elapsed after its issue and the issuer shows no signs of
keeping his word. As money is only a measure of Services,
and as possible Services are limited at any one time
and place, and consequently as the amount of money
needed for healthful business is limited also, a steadily
convertible paper money, provided the limit of quantity
be not overpassed, will constitute a tolerable money. But
this limit of quantity is apt to be overpassed, whether the
paper money be convertible or inconvertible, and especially
in the latter case, because the temptation to issue promises
to pay in excess of the means of promptly redeeming them
always besets the issuer on account of the <i>gain</i> to him in
such issue at least for a time. This temptation has been
yielded to first or last by every nation, and probably by
every corporation, that has ever issued paper money. The
Bank of England has been on the whole the best managed
Bank of Issue in the world, and its Bills (Promises) have
gained the most confidence and the widest circulation.
This is because they have been kept by the Issuers <i>convertible</i>
from the beginning, with the exception of two
comparatively brief intervals of time. As already related
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[431]</a></span>
under the last general proposition, the silver coins of the
realm were much worn and clipped when the Bank was
established in 1694, the Bank, however, had received them
on deposit of customers at their full nominal value; but
after the Recoinage began in 1696, it was obliged under
the law to redeem its Bills in new coin of full weight, that
is, for perhaps 9 ounces of silver received, it was now
bound to pay 12. Consequently its enemies, the Jacobites,
made a "run" upon the Bank by collecting up its
Bills to a large amount and presenting them for payment.
The Bank was obliged to suspend payment, at first partially,
and then generally. In February, 1697, the Bills
were 24% below par. The Promises could not be kept,
and therefore they drooped in value according to man's
estimation of the probability of their becoming again <i>convertible</i>,
which happened in the course of that year under a
new charter and privileges from Government to the Bank.</p>

<p>Just 100 years after the first suspension of specie payments,
in 1797, when the War of the French Revolution
made such demands upon the English for money, the Bank
broke its solemn promises the second time, and did not
formally resume payments until 1821. Government and
the business men of London did their best to hold up the
credit of the notes during the suspension, <i>but they were not
made a legal tender for debts</i>. Government received them
at par for taxes, and provided that business payments in
notes would be held as payments in cash if offered and
accepted as such. Debtors, having tendered bank notes,
which the creditor refused, had certain privileges before
the law which other debtors had not. The notes therefore
had a <i>quasi</i> legalization, but not a forced circulation. The
bank was also authorized at this time to issue £5, £2, and
£1 notes. Cautiously issued at first, bank paper continued
at par for several years after the suspension, which proves
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[432]</a></span>
that when government possesses the monopoly of issuing
paper money, and carefully limits its quantity, and both
receives and pays it out at par, it may keep an inconvertible
paper at par, or even by sufficiently limiting its quantity
carry it above par. But this truth does not make an
inconvertible paper a good money, because it does not
make it a self-regulating money, and because government
is not wise and firm enough to fix and maintain a proper
limit. Though Parliament intended in successive acts to
confirm to the Bank of England the monopoly of banking
by enacting that no partnership of more than six persons
should take up money on its own bills, yet the common law
assured to private persons and smaller partnerships the
right to do this; and private bankers multiplied after the
suspension, since they were allowed to pay their notes in
Bank of England notes. Thus the quantity of paper money
gradually increased till in August, 1813, the Bank of England
notes were at 30% discount in gold.</p>

<p>The United States, both as Colonies and as a Country,
have had varied and instructive experience with inconvertible
paper Money. We will glance at two or three specimens
only. The first issue of Treasury Notes, commonly
called Greenbacks, given by Congress the quality of legal
tender for all debts, public and private, except duties on
imports and interest and principal of the national bonds,
was made in April, 1862, and was justified in Congress
and out solely as a war measure. An aggregate of $450,000,000
was put out in all, of which $87,000,000 were
afterwards taken in, and the balance was still circulating
in 1890. In one month after the first issue of $150,000,000,
these greenbacks began to droop in value as compared with
gold; in four months, when the second batch of $150,000,000
was authorized, their depreciation was already marked
and firm; and in nine months, when President Lincoln
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[433]</a></span>
reluctantly gave his approval to the third issue of the
same amount in order to pay off the soldiers and sailors,
he uttered a solemn protest against the policy of thus inflating
the current money, which, he said, "<i>has already become
so redundant as to increase prices beyond real values, thereby
augmenting the cost of living to the injury of labor, and the
cost of supplies to the injury of the whole country</i>." In
March, 1863, $50,000,000 of paper promises for fractions
of a dollar were authorized, redeemable in sums of not less
than three dollars in greenbacks, and receivable for all
dues to the United States less than five dollars, except for
duties on imports. Subsidiary silver coins have since taken
the place of these fractionals. In July, 1863, the greenback
dollar had lost one-quarter of its nominal value; in
July, 1864, it had lost almost two-thirds of its nominal
value, as its lowest point was reached in that month,
namely, 35 cents as compared with the gold dollar; in
July, 1865, it had risen to 70 cents; in July, 1866, it stood
at 66 cents, just two-thirds of a dollar proper; and from
that time it slowly rose, with many fluctuations, till New
Year's, 1879, when it became legally and actually redeemable
in gold and silver. Its variations for the sixteen
years, however, cannot be counted by the number of years,
nor even by the number of days; for they were numerous
on each business day, and, as Comptroller Knox says, "<i>can
only be numbered by tens of thousands</i>." What a Measure
of Services that was!</p>

<p>Between 1863 and 1879 the Bills of the new national
Banks were redeemable in the greenbacks only, that is to
say, one species of national promises-to-pay were paid on
demand by another species of similar promises, both alike
inconvertible into coin; and, as a natural consequence, the
bank-bills bobbed up and down in value in servile obedience
to the inconvertible legal tenders.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span></p>

<p>Massachusetts Colony was the first constituent of the
present United States both to mint silver, and to issue
irredeemable promises to pay it. Under the false impression
that only Money made inferior to Sterling would
stay in the Colony, Massachusetts began to mint in 1652
silver shillings and sixpences and threepences purposely
debased in weight (including seigniorage) 22% below
sterling. The silver for these coins came in mostly from
the trade with the West Indies, to which were now shipped
peltry, fish, various forms of lumber, beef, pork, pease, cattle,
and horses, for which they took mainly sugar, molasses,
rum, and silver. "<i>They would have brought more silver
and less rum and other merchandise, had the first been in
greater request at home.</i>" (Bronson.) John Hull, the mint-master
took out 15 pence out of every £ for his own pay,
and grew rich by the process. That was over 6%. In
1662, a twopenny piece was added to the series, and the
mint existed (sometimes idle) for over 30 years, but all
the pieces coined bore the dates of 1652 or 1662. This
paucity of dates is commonly and perhaps properly accounted
for on the ground that coining in the colony was
contrary to the prerogative of the Crown; but it is to be
added that John Hull was not a man to get new dies so
long as the old ones would answer his purpose. The law
forbade the exportation of these pieces under the penalty
of thereby forfeiting one's whole visible estate; because,
though this money was much worse than sterling, there
was a worse money than this circulating in the colony,
and Gresham's law began to crowd it from the first, and to
some extent it was both smuggled out and clipped down.
But it furnished a sort of standard, nevertheless, and
tended to keep the later money within distant sight of the
silver, and became the reason why in New England there
were six shillings to the dollar. The Spanish pillar dollar,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[435]</a></span>
which was the standard in the West Indies, was worth 4<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>
sterling; and in 1672 a law was passed in Massachusetts
allowing these dollars to circulate at 6<i>s.</i> provincial, which
was a discount on the home pieces of 25%. Ever after
there were six shillings in a dollar in New England. Hull's
money is called the "pine-tree" coinage, and was the only
coin money minted in the country till after Independence.</p>

<p>Also in 1690 Massachusetts set the first example, which
was imitated 20 years later by the other New England
Colonies and by New York and New Jersey, of issuing
"Bills of Credit" to meet the expenses of the two disastrous
Expeditions against the French in Canada. Those
Bills were not made legal tender in private payments, and
pains were taken to keep up their credit, but they were
depreciated from the first, and came to be very much
depreciated. Massachusetts and Connecticut made their
bills receivable for taxes at a premium of 5%, laid special
taxes for their redemption, and from time to time called
in portions of the issues. In 1718 Connecticut enacted
that a debtor tendering these bills should not be liable to
legal execution on his estate or person for the payment of
that debt, an expedient, as we have seen, resorted to by
England in the great Bank restriction of 1797-1821.
These early New England bills bore no interest, were not
loaned out by the colony, and were a convenient though
dangerous means of anticipating the income of future
taxes; but after 1712 a paper money scheme originating in
South Carolina came into favor in the colonies, which was,
to open loan-offices for the issue of colony bills on the
mortgage of land, the interest on which helped to pay the
colony expenses, the principal of which at first, and on
being paid back and re-loaned, furnished a capital to borrowers,
while the bills themselves furnished a money for
the people. Pennsylvania had the best luck with this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[436]</a></span>
scheme of all the colonies which tried it: as early as 1729
Benjamin Franklin became thoroughly possessed of John
Law's notion, that paper money may be "based" on land
or other valuables, saying in a pamphlet of that year that
"<i>bills issued upon land are in effect coined land</i>": Pennsylvania
bills nevertheless were at 46% discount in 1748.
Some of the later colony bills bore interest, some were of a
"new-tenor," so-called, designed to take up the old ones,&mdash;Virginia
in 1755 made hers a legal tender for debts,&mdash;some
were issued in bounties for Indian scalps and for various
manufactures and fisheries, but all ran one road of depreciation
and gave birth to one set of results. Connecticut
managed her issues the best of the colonies, and yet
Bronson says of the state of things in that colony in 1749,
"<i>Trade was embarrassed and the utmost confusion prevailed:
no safe estimate could be made as to the future, and credit
was almost at an end: no man could safely enter into a contract
which was to be discharged in money at a subsequent
date: prudence and sagacity in the management of business
were without their customary reward.</i>"</p>

<p>John Law, a shrewd Scotchman, born in Edinburgh in
1671, son of a goldsmith, with an innate talent for finance
and well educated, was the first to give scientific form and
color to the false theory that paper money <i>represents</i> commodities
of some sort, and may be issued to an amount
equal to the value of these. "<i>Any goods that have the
qualities necessary in money may be made money equal to
their value. Five ounces of gold is equal in value to £20,
and may be made money to that value; an acre of land is
equal to £20, and may be made money equal to that value,
for it has all the qualities necessary in money.</i>" The fallacy
in these words of Law is patent enough to any one
who will stop to think a moment about the <i>nature of
Money</i>. Because land, for example, has value, it does not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[437]</a></span>
follow that it has "<i>all the qualities necessary in money</i>";
and, as a matter of fact, it lacks the precise quality necessary
in money, because, though it has purchasing-power, it
cannot from its very form and nature become <i>a generalized
and current</i> purchasing-power. Money is indeed a valuable
thing, but that does not prove that all valuable things
can be money. With this radical vice of Law's view was
wrapped up another, namely, that there may be in any
country as much paper money as the sum of the values of
all its valuable things. Now, we have learned perfectly,
what escaped the acute intellect of John Law, that Money
is only a valuable <i>measure</i> of all other salable Services;
and therefore, that the amount of it that can be made useful
at any one time and place is strictly limited, and bears
very little relation to the sum of the values present at that
time and place.</p>

<p>Scotland fought shy of Law's idea when he published it
there in 1705, and so did Paris the first time he visited
that city, in which and in other cities he gambled successfully
and talked finance to princes and statesmen fascinatingly;
but when he returned to Paris in 1715 with his
ill-gotten fortune, he gained the ear of the Regent Duke
of Orleans, who permitted him to found a bank there, in
which were incorporated some sound principles of monetary
science as well as the prime fallacy of his system.
The bank bought a portion of the State Debt, just as the
Bank of England had done, and laid in also a fair stock of
coin, and thereupon issued a paper money. For a couple
of years, or so, the bank surpassed all hopes, for Law had
touched a spring till then but little known in France, the
potent spring of Credit. But his whole thought, meditated
on for years, could not be expressed through a private
bank. The State should be a banker; it should collect all
its revenues into a central bank, and attract the money of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[438]</a></span>
individuals to it as deposits; besides, the State has public
property of vast value, on the strength of which paper
money can be emitted and made legal tender; and thus
the State, instead of borrowing, should lend to all on easy
terms and the profits thus accruing would lessen or abolish
taxes. Nor was this all. The State should also be a
merchant; the whole nation should form a commercial
company, a body of traders, whose common treasury should
be the State bank. Commerce by individuals creates
great wealth; why should not the organized commerce of
a State make everybody rich? The discounts of the bank,
and the profits of the trade, would surely provide for the
public service without taxation. These vast ideas were
actually carried out. Law's bank became the Royal Bank,
issuing a paper money guaranteed by the State and resting
back upon the value of all national property. The money
was receivable in taxes, nominally redeemable in coin, and
made a legal tender. It actually bore at one time 5 and
10% premium over gold and silver. People were anxious
to exchange their coin for notes. Meanwhile a commercial
company was formed in connection with the bank, to
which the State ceded at first the monopoly of the commerce
of Louisiana and of the Canada beaver trade for
twenty-five years, and the soil of Louisiana forever; under
the auspices of which <span class="smcap">New Orleans</span> was founded, and
named from the Regent, the patron of the grand system;
and in succession, the monopoly of tobaccos, the rights of
the Senegal Company, of the East India Company, of the
China Company, and of the Barbary Company; until, having
almost all the commerce of France outside of Europe
in its hands, it entitled itself the <span class="smcap">Company of the Indies</span>.
Its shares rose from a par value of 500 francs to 10,000
francs, more than forty times their value in specie at their
first emission. To support such speculations, which completely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[439]</a></span>
turned the heads of all classes of the people, the
amount of paper money reached at last the sum of
3,071,000,000 francs, 833,000,000 more than had been
legally authorized to be emitted. The collapse of this
most gigantic bubble of history was terrific. Before the
close of 1720, the shares of the Company could be bought
for a louis d'or, or twenty shillings sterling, and the paper
money of course became worthless.</p>

<p>The ghost of John Law reappears gibbering and chattering
in some human shape once in a generation or two
in all civilized countries. In March, 1890, Senator Stanford
of California, himself reputed to be worth $30,000,000,
propounded the question in the Senate of the United
States, whether it were not advisable for the Government
to issue legal-tender notes on the basis of the real estate
of the country. His interrogative argumentation implied,
(1) that there was a scarcity of Money causing great
hardship to individuals and depression to business, (2)
that if national bank bills are properly issued on government
bonds it is equally proper to base legal tenders on
real property, (3) that there is no natural and strict limitation
to the amount of Money in a country at any one
time, and (4) that as far as he knows there may well
enough be as much money in amount as the estimated
value of the real estate. All this is John Lawism pure
and simple. All this utterly ignores the nature of Money
as a valuable measure of all other Services. It also ignores
the truth, that an advancing country needs less rather than
more Money in amount as it advances, because cheques
and other forms of non-money Credits are constantly
increasing both absolutely and relatively. It is because
this Senator's monetary notions seemed to correspond with
those of a majority of the Senate, that it is perhaps proper
to give them here a moment's attention.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[440]</a></span></p>

<p>These supposed legal-tender notes would be secured by
a government lien on land and buildings, and by the direct
credit of the Government as well; just as the national
bank bills are secured by the bonds of the nation held in
reserve for that purpose, and also by the direct image and
superscription of Cæsar upon every bill. People holding
mortgaged real estate could accept a non-interest bearing
government lien instead of a 6% or 8% private mortgage,
that is, could pay off their mortgages with the legal tenders
given them by the Government, the latter taking the
lien or new mortgage; and people owning real estate clear
could, if they chose, execute a perpetual mortgage to the
Government, that is, give up the fee simple to their lands,
and receive legal-tender notes to the full amount in return.
This would at least relieve the "scarcity" of Money!
The volume of national Money at that moment was in
round numbers $1,400,000,000; the assessed valuation of
the real property of the country was at the same moment
at least $15,000,000,000; so that, on this scheme, perhaps
$10,000,000,000 of additional legal-tender Money could be
issued! Here is paternalism and socialism and John Lawism
all combined. Here is a Government of strictly limited
and carefully enumerated powers, under a written
Constitution as precise as language can make it, containing
the solemn declaration that all "powers not delegated to
the United States are reserved to the States respectively
or to the People," owning or soon to own not only the
railroads and the telegraphs but also the major part of the
lands of a free country, and going into the mortgage business
on the heroic scale!</p>

<p>If this honorable Senator and his like-minded colleagues
were tolerably familiar with the financial history of their
country, and perhaps they were, they would have known
that this precise scheme had had a practical trial in Rhode
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[441]</a></span>
Island, just before the adoption of the national Constitution.
The Legislature authorized the issue of $500,000 in
scrip-money based upon the value of the real estate of the
farmers of the Colony. The law required a mortgage
for twice the amount of scrip-money based upon it, and
it was therefore supposed the money would be as good as
gold or better. But somehow or other the merchants of
the towns could not see the matter in that light. The
depreciation of the scrip-money began at once, and the
prices of wares ran up in a way that should have set business
in active motion, according to all the views of the
"scarcity" school. It was therefore enacted by the Legislature,
that anybody who refused to accept the scrip at its
face value should be fined $500 and lose the right of
suffrage! They made it a legal tender! But business
refused to boom. The merchants shut up their stores, the
farmers could not market their crops, and idleness and
rioting set in all over the State. Then the farmers organized
a boycott against the towns, and food became scarce.
Meanwhile the mortgage legal tenders would not pass at
the best for over 16 cents to the dollar! There was more
of "enforcing" legislation, and appeal to the courts, but
nothing could boost the mortgage-money. The chief result
of the experiment was, that Rhode Island gained in this
way the title of "Rogues' Island."</p>

<p>No matter how good the cause, how patriotic the People,
an inconvertible paper money is sure to run down at the
heel. In June, 1775, one week after Bunker Hill, the
Continental Congress voted to emit $2,000,000 in "Bills
of Credit" issued on the faith of the "Continent." Eleven
separate Colonies, New Hampshire and Georgia issuing
none, began about the same time their revolutionary issues
of the same sort, amounting in all during 1775-83 to
$209,524,776. The vice of such irredeemable scrip is,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[442]</a></span>
there is no economical limitation of the Supply. The
middle of 1777, when Burgoyne was prosperously advancing
from Canada towards New York, saw a general fall of
the notes both Continental and Colonial, and of course and
in consequence a universal rise of the prices of other products.
At the close of that year, the average depreciation
from silver was not far from 3 to 1; at the close of 1778,
it was not far from 6 to 1; at the end of 1779, it was
about 28 to 1; the Continental press then rested, after
$200,000,000 nominally had been put out, but actually
about $40,000,000 more than that, a usual if not universal
accompaniment of such issues. When the stuff dropped
out altogether in the spring of 1781, the country found no
more lack of silver for Money than Massachusetts had
found in 1749, when and after she redeemed her outstanding
bills of credit at 11 for 1 in sterling silver, £138,649
of which, the share falling to her from the capture of
Louisburg, was shipped to the Colony in coin, and she
became for the next 25 years the "Silver Colony." Assuming
that only $200,000,000 Continental had been issued,
Thomas Jefferson carefully estimated that the Nation
realized from them $36,367,720 in specie value, or 18% of
the nominal value.</p>

<p>14. Whether the Money of any Nation be coin or paper
or both, when once it is in the hands of the People, Government
has properly nothing to say <i>about the rate of
interest at which one person loans this money to another</i>.
Usury Laws so-called, prohibiting the lender from taking
more than a prescribed rate % for the use of money loaned,
under penalties sometimes of the entire interest and sometimes
of the entire debt have disfigured the statute-books
of all Nations and of all the States of this Union. Such
laws cannot justify themselves for a moment in the light of
sound principles of Political Economy. Their origin may
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[443]</a></span>
be explained by a reference to two false views, now happily
exploded.</p>

<p>(a) The laws of Moses forbade to the Israelites the
taking from one another any <i>interest</i> on money loaned, but
at the same time it allowed them to take such interest
freely of strangers; the permission in the one case going
to show that there is nothing in the taking of interest that
is unjust or sinful, and the prohibition in the other being
readily explainable from the general purpose of the
municipal regulations of Moses, which was to found an
agricultural and not a trading commonwealth, in which
every family was to possess land that could not be permanently
alienated or sold, in which it was a great object to
maintain the personal independence and equality of these
families, in which the law for the recovery of debts was
very summary and effective, lessening the risk of losing
the principal, and which was to be and was sedulously
separated in its usages from the surrounding nations. It
has been well understood for a long time that the municipal
code of Moses was local and peculiar, not necessarily applicable
at all to the circumstances of other States, and in no
sense binding on the conscience of legislators; and yet
there doubtless sprang from the prohibition referred to a
prejudice against interest, and this prejudice was perhaps
deepened in the Middle Ages and onwards by the conduct
of the Jews themselves, who, in addition to their sin of
persistently growing rich in spite of the endless disabilities
laid on them by the people of Europe, always demanded,
in accordance with the permission of their great lawgiver,
a good rate <i>per centum</i> of interest from those strangers to
whom they became money-lenders. The Jews were everywhere
hated, and consequently the usury which they
practised was hated also. The fundamental absurdity of
forbidding in trading communities the taking of interest on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[444]</a></span>
sums loaned to a borrower which he was at liberty to use
for his own profit, deterred the nations from going to the
length of prohibition, unless it might be in the case of the
hated Jews. There is a clause of Magna Charta, interesting
as showing how early the children of Abraham became the
money-lenders of Europe, to the effect that, during the
minority of any baron, while his lands are in wardship, no
debt which he owes to the Jews shall bear any interest.</p>

<p>(b) Governments formerly deemed themselves competent
to determine and fix the <i>general</i> purchasing-power of their
own money. Even the Constitution of the United States
uses this language: "to coin money, <i>regulate the value
thereof, and of foreign coins</i>." There was formerly, and
there is still to some extent, a curious and harmful confusion
in the public mind in respect to this term, "the value of
money." In the only proper sense of the term the <i>value
of money</i> means its power of purchasing services in general,
and the value of money is <i>high</i> when a given sum of it will
purchase much of general services, and <i>low</i> in the contrary
case; and a high or low value of money in this true sense
depends on a very distinct set of causes from those which
determine the high or low rate of interest on money loaned;
nevertheless, so long as governments supposed that they
could regulate the former, it is very natural that they
should also suppose that they could regulate the latter; and
although all intelligent governments have given over the
idea of being able to regulate the general value of the
money they furnish to the people, many of them still adhere
to the notion, equally false with the other, that they <i>are</i>
able to regulate the loanable value, or the rate of interest,
at least to prevent any more than their prescribed maximum
rate from being taken. A few simple considerations
will sufficiently condemn all usury laws.</p>

<p>(1) It is at once needless and invidious to deny by law
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[445]</a></span>
to money-lenders, who offer just as honorable and useful
services to society as any other class of men, the privilege
of selling <i>their</i> service for what it will bring in the market,
while other men in every department of business are
allowed to exchange their services on the best terms they
can make without interference or control. Let us see precisely
the nature of the transaction when one man loans
money to another. It is a clear case of value. The lender
does a service to the borrower, and for this service justly
demands a compensation. The service is this: The lender
might himself use the money to gratify his own desires. It
is his money; he may use it, as he pleases, for his own
gratification. Or he may himself employ it productively,
and, at the end of the period, receive back his principal
with the customary rate of profit. If he surrenders this
advantage to the borrower, if he passes over to him the
right to use this money, say, for a year, he practises what
we call in Political Economy <i>abstinence</i>. For this abstinence
he has a right to claim a reward, precisely as the
man has a right to claim a reward who foregoes working
for himself in order to work for another. This reward
of abstinence is <i>interest</i>. The money-lender foregoes an
advantage. He performs a service for the borrower; and,
therefore, the right to interest stands on just as unassailable
ground as the right to wages. Moreover, the loanable
value of money varies under Supply and Demand just like
other values; there are always those who want to borrow,
and always those who want to lend; both parties must be
assumed to know their own minds, and to be equally competent
to make their own bargains; it is a case of mutual
exchange for a mutual benefit, like all other trade; and
the current rate of interest is determined at any one
time by the actual free exchanges between borrowers and
lenders. Now for any government to try to compel a lender
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[446]</a></span>
by law to take only 6% when his money is worth 8, is a
direct violation of the rights of property. It is a forcible
and pernicious interference with the freedom of contracts.
It is based on the false premise that the loanable value of
money is uniform, and that government is competent to
determine what it is. No value is uniform. And no government
is competent to determine even the maximum
price of money loaned, any more than the maximum price
of commodities.</p>

<p>(2) Usury laws are almost uniformly <i>disregarded</i>, both
by the governments which make them and by the people
for whom they are made. Indeed, such laws cannot be
enforced in a commercial community. Common sense is
outraged by a law which requires a man to part with his
property at less than the actual value; and when common
sense is against a law, it stands a slim chance of observance.
If the legal rate be six, and the actual worth be eight, who
lends at six? Not the banks. They require deposits of
their customers, the use of whose money shall make up to
them the difference between the legal and the actual rate.
The modes of evasion are various, but they are adequate
and universal. Besides, governments themselves have
shown a noteworthy inconsistency in this matter, which
incidentally proves the unsoundness of their whole action.
While announcing pains and penalties to those who take
more than a given rate, they are careful never to bind
themselves down to any given rate. Governments are
always more or less borrowers, and if usury laws are necessary
in order to help borrowers in a pinch, there ought to
be a clause in the organic law of every country, forbidding
the government to pay and its lenders to take any more
than a certain rate per cent. There is no such clause in
any organic law. Governments wisely follow the natural
market, and borrow low when they can, and pay high when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[447]</a></span>
they must. In the last months of Mr. Buchanan's administration,
the United States paid 12% on a public loan, and
could get but little at that. Sauce for the goose is sauce
for the gander, and if usury laws are good for the citizens,
some solid reason ought to be rendered why they are not
good for the government. The truth is, they are not good
for either, since natural laws are perfectly competent to
regulate the rate of interest, and do regulate it substantially
in spite of a factitious, impertinent, and mischief-making
interference.</p>

<p>(3) If Usury laws were <i>not</i> disregarded, they would be
even worse in their effects than they are now. We must
suppose that their aim is to aid borrowers, and make it
easier for them to contract loans. But are borrowers, as a
class, any more deserving of the fostering care of government
than are lenders? Even if it could make its interference
effective, as it cannot, is there any reason why
government, leaving these borrowers to make all other
bargains, sales, and transfers according to their best skill
and judgment, should rush to their rescue only when they
propose to borrow money? If they are competent to do
their other business for themselves, government pays their
capacity a poor compliment in undertaking to help them in
the single matter of making loans; and the borrowers in
turn have reason to pray to be delivered from their friends,
since they, of all others, would be the men especially
injured if all the lenders obeyed the usury laws. Suppose
that a borrower is in great need of a loan, and that for
some reason his credit is now a little weak. Many men
would be willing to loan him at 9%, which affords a margin
for the extra risk, but at 6, which we will suppose the maximum
allowed by the law, he cannot borrow a dollar, because
his credit is not quite equal to the best. If, therefore,
the lenders obey the law, he, and such as he, must
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[448]</a></span>
fail. And because it is unlawful to take over 6% he will
be obliged to pay those who are willing to violate the law
10 or 12, to compensate them for the risk and odium of
such violation, while, under freedom, he could borrow at 8.
Moreover, if the loanable value of money at the time be
actually 9, while the law only allows 6, many men will
attempt to use their own capital productively, who would
otherwise loan it, in order to realize the high rate; and
this action of theirs still further restricts the loan-market
and makes it more difficult to borrow. If, then, the purpose
of government be to aid borrowers, no means could be
more unskilfully chosen for that end than to pass usury laws,
since such laws, so far as they are obeyed, have necessarily
the opposite tendency; and even when violated redound
to the disadvantage of borrowers, so long as the laws themselves
are popularly regarded as of any legal or moral
force.</p>

<p>In 1716, the Bank of England, as a great loaning institution,
was exempted from the operation of all usury laws:
why the bank only, and not other people as well, the Act
of Parliament does not state. In 1867, the State of Massachusetts
repealed all its usury laws, though 6% is to be
understood in the absence of special agreement, and the
result has been entirely satisfactory to all classes of the
people. Rhode Island had done this previously, and Connecticut
did it subsequently, and both have experienced
equal satisfaction in the result. Other States will soon
follow in their lead; and this relic of ignorance and prejudice
will pass away. Adam Smith left the Wealth of
Nations disfigured by the concession that governments
might properly enough pass usury laws; but it is gratifying
to be able to add that he was convinced of his error in
that by Bentham's book on Usury, and fully acknowledged
his conviction in the spirit of a genuine lover of truth.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[449]</a></span>
We conclude, then, that usury laws are needless, since interest,
like all other prices, will perfectly adjust itself. They
are disregarded, since lenders will loan or withhold their
money according to their own keen sense of interest. They
are pernicious, since they infringe the rights of property,
and tend to prevent weak borrowers from having a fair
chance in the market.</p>

<p>The present writing is at midsummer, 1890; and, in
order to complete the entire discussion so far as this country
is concerned, it is needful to add, that, between 1878
(when specie payments were resumed) and 1890, the circulating
medium of all kinds is proven by official statistics
of the highest authority to have increased from $805,793,807
to $1,405,018,000, or more than 57 <i>per centum</i>. This
circulating medium consists of six formal kinds; namely,
gold, silver, greenbanks, bank-bills, gold-certificates, and
silver-certificates. Each of these differs in important
respects from each of the rest, but all come alike under
our fundamental classification of Moneys, as either an
intermediate merchandise or promises to render it. This
increase is way beyond any increase in the population of
the country, and way beyond any apparent or proven increase
in the national business; while at the same time the
banking facilities of the country, which always spare the
use of Money by substituting cheques therefor in the wholesale
business and in a large share of the retail business also,
have been increasing in equal measure. The number of
national banks, especially in the West and South, has been
multiplying. The use of cheques has been enlarging in
every commercial community in the land. Yet up to the
present time all of this vast volume of Money has been
kept at par with gold, and consequently at the highest
state of efficiency for commercial purposes.</p>

<p>What about the immediate future? Science is not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[450]</a></span>
prophecy except in a quite subordinate sense. Congress
is loudly threatening at this very moment to more than
double the enforced monthly coinage of silver dollars at
the public expense for the sole benefit of a comparatively
few miners of silver. If this threat be executed upon a
long-suffering people of tax-payers, who will have no one
to blame but themselves if they tolerate the outrage,
Science is willing to venture the prediction, that the
monetary standard here will drop from gold to silver
within a twelvemonth or two; that general prices will rise
much beyond the appreciation of money implied in that
drop, though they will be illusory and gainless; that prudent
debtors will hold high carnival for a time at the expense
of their creditors; that the country will become as
empty of gold as a contribution-box is of other money
between Sundays; that foreign trade (soon to be explained),
already in a sickening decline, under restrictions
and prohibitions, will hasten to a practical demise;
and that the United States, at once the laughing-stock and
the victim to the superior intelligence of other nations, will
come through alternate fever and chills to a position of
common sense and ultimate recovery.</p>

<small>FOREIGN TRADE.</small></h2>


<p>Wonderful is the continuity in the growth of any
great Science, and equally so the persistency of any radical
error that once gets fairly imbedded within it. As we
saw fully in the last chapter Money is nothing in the
world but a convenient, intermediate, equivalent, and
easily measurable merchandise; but almost as soon as men
began to analyze Sales and to generalize from their data, a
notion nestled way down in their work, that Sales against
Money were somehow or other different from Sales against
other merchandise; and thence sprang up, particularly
among the Romans, what we have called the Bullion
Theory. The broad and the true view was held indeed
from the beginning, and was maintained even among the
Romans, as we learn from an interesting passage in the
Roman Law,&mdash;"<i>Sabinus and Cassius think Value can
dwell in another thing than money too, whence is that which
was commonly said, Buying and Selling is carried on in the
exchange of goods, and that view of purchase and sale is very
old; but the opinion of Procullus has deservedly prevailed,
who says, Exchange is a particular kind of transaction different
from Selling.</i>"</p>

<p>Science has indeed sloughed off this old and vital error,
and most of its sequels; but Public Opinion in many
countries is full of it still; and Legislation, in our own
country at least, is all the time trying or threatening to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[452]</a></span>
transmute merchandise (say silver) into money, as if that
could raise its value or change its nature.</p>

<p>It was but a single step from the Bullion Theory to the
Mercantile System. If money be somehow different from
and better than merchandise, then each nation should
strive to handle its foreign trade so as to get back from
other nations more money than it renders to them in
exchange: in other words, each nation must try to sell to
the rest more goods than it takes goods back in pay, so as
to have a "<i>balance</i>" come in of gold and silver. How
natural the transition from Bullionism to Mercantileism!
And it was a step of genuine progress too. Goods are
good, and there is profit in their exchange; but gold is
somehow better than goods, and we must manage somehow
to get a "balance" in that! If this position had
only been sound, and one nation only been in possession
of the precious secret, how nicely it might have worked
for that nation! But all the leading Nations of Europe
made the transition from Bullionism to Mercantileism at
one and the same time, and they vexed and impoverished
each other for three half-centuries, and went to war with
each other besides, under the double illusion, (1) that gold
could be practically gotten in that way, and (2) that if
gotten it were one whit better than the goods for which
it would have been at once spent.</p>

<p>Economics as a Science is now free from every taint of
Mercantileism also, but it lingers on more or less in half-informed
minds, and in the less-experienced nations; and
the system itself merged itself three half-centuries ago
into another, which is not another, namely, into Protectionism.
If nation A must sell more goods to nation B
than it takes back in goods, so as to get the coveted
"balance" in gold from B, would it not help that cause
along to put obstacles in the way of restrictions or prohibitions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[453]</a></span>
against the introduction of goods from B to A?
Less goods, more gold, argues A. A forgets that the same
mental processes are going forward in B's mind towards
the same conclusion in relation to A. Now, cogitates A,
what kind of goods from B had we better restrict or prohibit?
A, by the way, consists of some millions of individuals,
some of whom are always on the watch to get
their axes ground at the government grindstone. What
kind of goods shall we prohibit from B? Why, of course,
those kinds which we are now making or growing. We
can supply these for ourselves. It does not escape the
notice of these makers and growers, that the restriction or
prohibition of similar goods from B will raise the price at
home of their own goods. Scarce is ever costly. On go
the restrictions, ostensibly at first in behalf of an imaginary
"balance" in gold, which fragile reason soon passes
out of mind in the presence of a very real reason for such
restrictions, namely, artificial high prices for certain domestic
goods, paid indeed by the entire home community
to the comparatively few makers or growers of the goods
now "protected," as the current phrase is. Mercantileism
has passed over into protectionism. The feeble friends of
a "balance" have now become the strong friends of a
"monopoly." Personal greed to grow rich at the expense
of one's own countrymen thus becomes the single or combined
force that puts on and keeps on and piles up the
so-called "protective" restrictions and prohibitions.</p>

<p>Scientifically Protectionism is as dead as Mercantileism
and Bullionism. There is not an Economist in Christendom,
of any international or even national reputation, who
now undertakes fairly and squarely by means of analysis
and induction, to propound or defend a scheme so contrary
to common sense and common honesty as this is, and
which, universally applied, would annihilate the commerce
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[454]</a></span>
of the world. But many of the nations are still tinctured
more or less by the old subtlety, and powerful classes
within them and specially within the United States, classes
grown rich and powerful by what is nothing else than
public plunder, are strenuous and successful advocates,
not in open discussion and fair debate but by clandestine
and corrupting methods and combinations, to maintain
in the light of the nineteenth century an outworn and
decrepit "something" worthy only of the dark ages. The
old and foolish cry for a "balance of trade" is merged
now in the United States into the insane and hateful
clamor for the destruction of public trade in the behalf of
private gain.</p>

<p>This is the sole reason why we must now undertake a
careful chapter on Foreign Trade. There is no reason in
the nature of things, or in the nature of trade, why Foreign
Commerce should be treated of separately from Domestic
Commerce. The two are precisely alike in all their principles
and in all their results. In one as in the other, in
every case and everywhere, there are (1) two persons, each
of whom has a Service in his hands to sell against a Service
in the hands of the other; (2) two reciprocal estimates,
by which each owner concludes that he prefers the Service
of the other to his own; (3) two mutual renderings, by
which each Service comes into the possession, present or
prospective, of the new owner; and (4) two personal satisfactions
as the result of all, constituting the ultimate
motive and the sole reward of Buying and Selling.</p>

<p>There are two possible differences in certain cases between
Domestic and Foreign trade, both superficial and but
barely worth the mention here. Foreign countries engaged
in trade <i>may</i> be more remote from each other than places
exchanging products within the same country. The distances,
however, between Bangor selling ice to New Orleans
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[455]</a></span>
for sugar, and Boston selling boots and shoes to San Francisco
for fruits and wine, are much greater than those
between Liverpool and St. Petersburg, or those between
Stockholm and Palermo; so that, it may be said in general,
that the trade between all the European countries
confronts less distances, and presumably less costs of transportation,
than the trade within the United States. And
another thing is to be said in this connection: Foreign
trade as a general rule is conducted by water-routes, and
domestic trade under the same rule is carried on by land-routes;
and, therefore, the costs of transportation by the
latter are much more expensive.</p>

<p>The other possible difference is more considerable, and
considerably more in favor of Foreign as compared with
Domestic trade. We have learned perfectly already, and
the point is fundamental, that all trade proceeds on the
sole basis of a relative Diversity of Advantage as between
the two parties exchanging. This relative superiority of
each exchanger over the other at different points depends in
domestic trade partly upon divergent natural gifts to individuals,
partly upon their concentration of mind or muscle
or both on a single class of efforts each, and partly upon
the use and familiarity in the use of the gratuitous helps
of Nature aiding that class of efforts. But in foreign trade
there are commonly some additional grounds of Diversity,
since the various countries of the earth have received from
the hands of God a diversity of original gifts, in climate,
soil, natural productions, position, and opportunity. And
besides these original international differences, there has
been developed of course in the history of the inhabitants
of these countries a diversity of tastes, aptitudes, habits,
strength, intelligence, and skill to avail themselves of the
forces of Nature around them. International trade, accordingly,
is somewhat more broadly and firmly based than the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[456]</a></span>
home trade can be, inasmuch as these international differences
are apt to be more inherent and less flexible than
domestic differences between individuals; it is on these
diversities, original, traditional and acquired, that international
commerce hangs; it could never have come into
existence without them; and it would cease instantly and
completely were they to fade out. Men engage in foreign
trade,&mdash;not for the pleasure of it,&mdash;but for the sake of
the mutual gain derivable to both parties; they desist from
it so soon as that mutual gain disappears; and there is no
gain in any series of exchanges, unless each party has a
superior power in producing that which is rendered, compared
with his power in producing that which is received.</p>

<p>With these few preliminaries, we pass now, in the first
place, to unfold in order the <span class="smcap">common and universal
principles of foreign trade</span>. For the sake of illustrating
these, we will now take a simple supposed case, a trade
between England and France in cottons and silks, and
follow it through clearly to the end.</p>

<p>1. When will it be mutually profitable for England,
that is, for certain English merchants, to send cottons to
France to buy silks with, and for France, that is, for certain
French traders, to send silks to England to buy cottons
with? Money and all other commodities except these two,
silks and cottons, are wholly out of the question now and
should be wholly out of our minds the while, though for
simplicity's sake we shall use the <i>denominations</i> of money
for comparing the respective efforts, translating pounds
and francs into dollars. The answer is easy: the trade
will be mutually profitable, when efforts bestowed in
France upon silks will procure through exchange with
England more of cottons than the same amount of efforts
bestowed in France upon cottons will produce of cottons
directly; <i>and</i> then, when efforts bestowed upon cottons in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[457]</a></span>
England will procure more of silks through exchange with
France than the same amount of efforts bestowed in England
upon silks will produce of silks directly. It is not a
question of the absolute cost of either commodity to the
parties producing it, or of a comparison of those absolute
costs at all, but a question of the relative cost of that produced
in either country compared with what would be the
cost of the other commodity were it to be produced in that
country. So long as there is a difference of relative efficiency
in the production of the two commodities in the
two countries, so long, setting aside the costs of carriage,
may there be a profitable exchange of the two. A demand
in each country for the product of the other is of course
presupposed in the illustration.</p>

<p>Suppose now, that Efforts in England on certain cottons
be gauged at $100, and that Efforts in France on certain
silks be gauged at $80, and that these finished commodities
then exchange even-handed against each other: is that a
losing trade for England and a gainful trade for France?
That is more than we can tell yet. That depends upon
the further decisive question, whether the Efforts gauged
at $100 if expended in England in the manufacture of silks
will procure as many and as good silks as the same obtain
in exchange with France; and whether the Efforts gauged
at $80 if expended in France on cottons directly will
secure as many of them as if expended on silks directly
and then traded off for cottons. In effect the Frenchmen
ask, Can we get more and better cottons by working on
silks and then trading them off for English cottons than
we can get by equivalent Efforts in working on cottons at
home? Likewise the Englishmen ask, Can we get more
and better silks by working on cottons at home and then
trading with France for silks than we can get by trying to
make silks directly? France by climate and soil and habitudes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[458]</a></span>
is better adapted to silks than cottons: England by
virtue of the same is better adapted to cottons than silks.</p>

<p>2. How does the Diversity of relative Advantage practically
work in foreign trade? Let us suppose that while
the cottons cost $100 in England, it would cost $120 to
manufacture there as good silks as can be made in France
for $80; and that while the silks cost but $80 in France,
it would cost $96 to make cottons there as good as the
English can make for $100. On this supposition France
can make both the silks and the cottons at a cheaper
absolute cost than England can. What of it? Does that
destroy the motive and the gain of an exchange between
the countries in these two articles? Let us see. By an
exchange with England, France gets for $80 in silks,
cottons which would otherwise cost her $96, which is a
handsome gain of 20%; while England gets for cottons
costing her $100 silks which would otherwise have cost
her $120, which is another handsome gain of 20%. Although
France can make each commodity for less absolute
money than England can make either of them, there is
a Diversity of relative Advantage; and, therefore, there
might be in this case, as there is actually in many such
cases, a very profitable trade. The efficiency of France in
making silks relatively to the efficiency of England in
making silks is in the ratio of 80 to 120, namely, a difference
of 50%; while the aptitudes of France in making
cottons relatively to that of England in making the same
is only in the ratio of 96 to 100, namely, a difference of
4<sup><big>1</big></sup>&frasl;<sub><big>6</big></sub>%.
So long as England offers in cottons a good market
for French silks, how utter the folly and large the loss
of France in going to work to make cottons!</p>

<p>In the majority of cases, doubtless, foreign trade takes
place in articles, in the production of one of which each of
the respective countries has an absolute advantage over
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[459]</a></span>
the other; but an every way advantageous trade may be
carried on in commodities, in the production of <i>both</i> of
which one nation shall have an absolute superiority over
the other, provided only that this superiority be <i>relatively
diverse</i> in the two commodities, as has just been shown.
This is an effectual answer to the ignorant clamor of some,
we take it, who make objection to importing articles which
might be made at home for the same sum of money as
foreigners expend in making them; admitted, that they
might be so made, does it follow that the country importing
them would get them as cheaply by making them
itself? <i>By no means does that follow.</i> Let no nation,
then, be in haste to drop a trade, because it thinks it can
make the goods received in exchange as cheaply as the
other nation makes them, so long as it has an advantage
absolute or relative over the other in making the goods
rendered in exchange; and when that advantage ceases, it
may be sure, that the trade will drop of itself; because it
always takes <i>motives</i> to make the mare go.</p>

<p>3. What are the extreme limits of the Value of cottons
and silks in the case supposed, and when will a third nation
be able to undersell either in the ports of the other? This
is the answer: the extreme value of French silks in English
cottons will be 80 and 96; they cannot fall below 80
because they cost the French that to manufacture them;
they cannot rise above 96, because at that rate the French
can make cottons, and there would be no motive, that is,
no <i>gain</i>, in their exchanging for cottons. Nations, that is
to say, individuals, will never get themselves served at a
greater effort than that at which they can serve themselves.
If a given effort does not realize more through exchange
than it would do directly, then that exchange ceases of
necessity, as fire goes out for lack of fuel. The extreme
limits of the value of English cottons in French silks will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[460]</a></span>
be 100 (lowest) and 120 (highest) for reasons precisely
similar in the case of the English. Therefore, the highest
profits possible to both nations under the conditions of the
trade are 20% each. France would be glad to take the
cottons at a return of 80 in silks, at which rate her gain
would be 20%, and she cannot under any circumstances
offer quite 96, at which rate her gain would disappear.</p>

<p>No third nation, accordingly, in a trade of silks for
cottons can expel the French from the English ports, until
it is prepared to offer nearly 96 (or more) in silks in return
for English cottons; that is to say, until its efficiency in
making silks relatively to that of England in making them
presents a greater difference than the difference of efficiency
between France and England in making silks, which is a
difference of 50%. England would be glad to take the
silks from France at a return of 100 in cottons, at which
rate her gain also is 20%, and she cannot possibly offer
quite 120 in cottons, because at that rate her gain would
wholly vanish. England could be undersold in the French
ports, when somebody is ready to offer nearly 120 (or more)
in cottons against the French silks, whose <i>quantum</i> in the
exchange may vary from 80 towards 96. Here is the whole
doctrine of one nation underselling another in the ports of
a third nation. Silks stand here for sample of all French
commodities of whatever name and cottons for all English
goods whatsoever; and England and France stand in the
illustration for any and all nationalities. Any nation
obtains any share or a greater share in the commerce of the
world solely in virtue of a greater relative efficiency in
producing <i>something</i> valuable, as compared with some other
nation's power in producing something <i>else</i> that is valuable.</p>

<p>4. How does the varying play of International Demand
affect the value of articles in foreign trade? The answer
is clear and easy: if the demand for French silks in England
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[461]</a></span>
just answers to the demand for English cottons in
France, so that the silks offered by France just pay for the
cottons offered by England, then, cost of carriage aside,
the gains of the trade will be equally divided between the
two sets of merchants, and each will realize 20% profits,
because neither will have any motive to lower the value of
its commodity below its highest value. The Frenchmen
from their point of view will offer 80 in silks and take 96
in cottons: the Englishmen from their standpoint will
offer 100 in cottons and get 120 in silks. Demand and
Supply are equalized at a point of value most favorable to
both parties, and one really determined by the relative cost
of production.</p>

<p>This case of equalization, though possible, is likely
rarely to occur in practice. On any terms of exchange
first offered, there is likely to be a stronger demand in one
country for the product of the other than in this country
for the product of that. This will of course lead to a
change of Value, and a new division of Profits. The
product for which the demand is less will find its market
sluggish, and in order to tempt further and brisker exchanges
will be compelled to offer more favorable conditions.
He who enters a market in quest of what is <i>more</i>
in demand with a service which is <i>less</i> in demand, will
have to lower his terms, or not trade. The equalization
of Supply and Demand will only be reached in this case,
by quickening the demand for the commodity now less in
demand through an offer of better terms in trade. Thus,
if the demand for French silks in the English ports be
slack, in comparison with the demand for English cottons
in France, at the rate of exchange first established, say, 80
for 96, the French merchant has no resource, if he wishes
to continue the trade, but to agree to give more silks, for
the same amount of cottons, say, 85 for 96. If this actual
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[462]</a></span>
reduction prove sufficient to cancel the account in cottons
with the account in silks, then the trade will proceed on
this new basis for a while, because the equalization of
demand and supply has been reached through a new valuation
of the two commodities, and there is now consequently
a new division of the profits. France gains less
than 13% by her trade with England, while England gains
27% in her trade with France.</p>

<p>Under these new terms of exchange, it is quite possible
that silks may again become heavy in reference to cottons,
and a new decline take place in their relative value. If
the French are obliged in consequence to offer 90 for 96,
in order to obtain the cottons they want, their own profits
will sink to 6%, while the same causes will lift the English
profits to 35%. If, in any contingency, the French were
driven by the state of the market to concede something
near to 96 in silks for 96 in cottons, the trade would cease
in that case, just as every transaction ceases when the
motive for it ceases. We must remember of course, that
the cottons of England are just as likely to become slack
in reference to silks, as the silks are relative to the cottons;
and when this happens, the English dealers will have to
lower their terms, and thus surrender a larger share of the
profits to the French. By this ceaseless play of Supply
and Demand, within the outermost limits drawn by the
relative Cost of Production at the time, is the Value of
commodities determined in Foreign Trade; and no degree
of complication in the variety of articles, or in circuitous
exchanges, affects, for substance, these fundamental principles.</p>

<p>5. What are the causes deciding the exportable articles
of any nation, and their order of precedence in Export?
Watch a little at this point, and the true answer will loom
up steady and certain. If, instead of one article, say
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[463]</a></span>
cottons, England sends two or ten kinds of goods to
France in payment for silks or wines or whatnot, she will
of course send in preference that commodity in which her
own commercial efforts are relatively most efficient, so
long as the French demand will receive it, because her
own profits will be the greatest on that; then, when obliged
to lower terms on that down to the point of relative advantage
at which her next available article stands, she will
send that next in quantities regulated by the demand for
that; and so on down to the end of the list of possible
exportables to France. France is guided as to her exportables
to England by precisely the same principles and
prospects of profit. So of all commercial nations whatsoever.
No matter whether the articles be one or many; no
matter whether the trade be a direct or indirect trade; the
profits in international commerce depend in all cases, first,
upon the ratio of the cost of what is rendered to what
would otherwise be the cost of what is received, secondly,
upon the relative intensity of the two Demands.</p>

<p>It follows logically and necessarily from all this, that
what a nation purchases by its exports, it purchases by its
own most efficient Production, and consequently at the
cheapest possible rate to itself, and at the highest possible
profit to its merchants. Under a decent freedom of international
choice and action, of sale and delivery, only <i>those
things</i> are ever exported, for the procuring of which a
nation possesses decided advantages relatively to other
nations, and relatively to its own advantages in producing
directly what is received in return; and hence, the return
cargoes, no matter what they have cost their original producers,
are purchased by this nation as cheaply as if
they had been produced by its own most advantageously
expended Effort. This is a wholly impregnable position;
and the advocates of restricting and prohibiting Foreign
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[464]</a></span>
Trade are challenged to try their hand a little or a good
deal (as best suits them) at its bristling defences.</p>

<p>It follows also from the discussion under this head, what
shallow thinkers are they, who deem it needful that each
nation should be able "<i>to compete</i>" with other nations in
every branch of production. Why are they not consistent
enough to apply their favorite catchword, "<i>compete</i>,"
to domestic exchanges also, and require that the clergyman
shall have artificial and governmental facilities for "<i>competing</i>"
with the lawyer, the tailor with the blacksmith,
the farmer with the manufacturer, the publisher with the
author? Will folks never learn that <i>all</i> Exchanges,
domestic as well as foreign, hang on relative superiority
at different points, and that any Nation trying to make its
success in production equal at all points would be just as
stupid as an artisan trying to learn and practice all the
trades at once? Suppose the said nation to succeed, what
then? It would supply its wants at a certain low average
efficiency of effort; whereas, by a thorough development
of all its own peculiar resources, it could command
by exchange the products of the whole world at a cost not
exceeding that of its own most productive and efficient
Exertion. The precious metals, whether produced at
home or obtained from other nations by another series
of exchanges, whether coined or in the form of bullion,
stand here in the same relations as other commodities, and
are frequently the most profitable articles that a nation
can export. In one word, whatever justifies individuals
in selecting diverse paths of production according to their
capacities and opportunity, the same (and even more) justifies
the Nations in fully drawing out their own best capabilities
under the conditions in which God has placed
them; and then, exchanging what costs them little for
what would otherwise cost them much, in enjoying all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[465]</a></span>
that the world offers at the least possible expenditure of
irksome effort. Such wise and wide action promotes the
common good of all the nations, and makes the best of all
accessible to all, and arms each with the power of all;
while the narrow and senseless policy of drawing into
one's own shell after putting up barricades against one's
neighbors, by lessening everywhere the Diversities of relative
Advantage, so far forth incapacitates all for profitable
and progressive Exchanges.</p>

<p>6. How do new improvements in machinery and other
enhanced facilities of Production in one country affect its
foreign trade? A cheering response will be drawn out, if
we now apply this question to the conditions of our old
trade in silks and cottons. Suppose France by new
methods of silk culture to become able to make the silk
which before cost $80 for $50, cottons in France and silk
and cottons in England remaining in natural cost as before,
does France alone gain the entire advantage of the
increased cheapness of silk? Wait a minute, and we will
see. The production of silk in France is greatly quickened
by the cheaper methods, more is produced, more is
carried to England to buy cottons with, but at the old rate
of 80 for 96, the English will not take any more silks, and
the French who can now abundantly afford it, since their
nominal 80 is really 50, will offer more silks for 96 in
cottons, in order to tempt a brisker and broader sale.
They offer, say, 96 in silks for 96 in cottons, and if that
reduction of Value of silks in cottons be enough for the
equalization of the respective Demands, the trade will proceed
on that basis, at least for a time; and as there is now
a larger difference of relative advantage than before, there
will be, as always in such cases, larger profits to be divided
between the two parties. The 96 now in silks to the
English is really only 60 in cost to the French, so that the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[466]</a></span>
French gain in the trade is largely increased; because
they now get for what costs them 60 what would otherwise
cost them 96, a clear gain of 60%. Before the new
methods of silk culture were introduced they could gain
but 20% at the utmost.</p>

<p>But the English have also reaped largely from the ingenuity
and diligence of their neighbors. Before, they
gained only 20% in the exchange at best; but now they
get for what cost them $100 that which would otherwise
cost them $144, a handsome profit of 44%. Indeed, it
might easily happen, through the incessant changes in
International Demand, that even a larger share of the
benefit of the French improvements should accrue to the
English than to the French themselves; the share of
the French all the while being large, and much larger,
than if, greedily endeavoring to keep all the benefit, they
should refuse to trade at all. Thus we reach again from
another outlook, a grand and universal doctrine of Exchange,
<i>that each party is benefited by the progress and
prosperity of the other</i>. Indeed, the only possible way in
which all nations can share in the thrift and enterprise
and improvements of each other, is through mutual international
exchanges; and when each nation sees to it that
it have a few commodities at least for which there is a
strong demand among foreigners, and in the production of
which themselves have a strong superiority, it may rest
assured that it buys all it buys from abroad, gold included,
at the cheapest rate to itself, and shares a part of the prosperity
of every nation with which it trades.</p>

<p>7. Which party in foreign trade pays the Costs of Carriage,
or do each pay them in equal proportion? It is
plain, that the aggregate cost of transportation to the foreign
markets is just so much added to the Cost of Production,
and is a deduction of so much from what would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[467]</a></span>
otherwise be the whole gain of the Commerce; but it is
plainly not true, that each party necessarily pays the whole
of his own freights; and, therefore, that the party carrying
bulky articles is at a disadvantage compared with the
other. He may or may not be at a disadvantage on that
account. That will depend on the effect of the new expense
for freight, however divided, on the Demand in each
country for the product of the other. We will suppose,
that in the outset England pays the whole cost of carrying
cottons to France, and France the whole cost of sending
silks to England; but as cottons are many times more
bulky than silks proportionably to value, a larger bill of
freights would fall of course to England; and cottons
would therefore fall in value relatively to silks; but cottons
and silks have both risen absolutely, that is, with reference
to any given effort, or with reference to a money
standard.</p>

<p>Suppose now that France, instead of 80 for 96, has to
render 82 for 96; and England, instead of 100 for 120,
now has to give 105 for 120. The French gain in the
trade is reduced from 20 to nearly 17%, and the English
gain from 20 to nearly 14%; but it is by no means certain,
that the commerce would go on precisely on these
terms; the enhanced value of silks might well deaden the
demand for them in England, more than the relatively less
enhanced value of cottons in France would affect the
demand for them. Silks have risen in England 5%, but
cottons have risen in France only 2&#189;%; it is therefore
very likely that thereafter the demand for cottons will be
stronger than the demand for silks, and if so, the French
will have to offer better terms, or, what is the same thing,
to be obliged to pay a part of the English freights; so
that there is nothing in the true state of the case to justify
the conclusion jumped at by some people, that they who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[468]</a></span>
carry heavy goods are at a disadvantage compared with
those who carry light goods. That will depend wholly
upon the Equation of International Demand as between
the two kinds of goods. Nothing in the nature of things
hinders, that each party shall in effect pay the freights of
the other, or one even really pay the freights of both.</p>

<p>8. Lastly, what is the effect upon international commerce
of the constant play of the Par of Foreign Exchange.
This is a point of great importance, that has
been but little discussed in this connection, because it has
not been popularly understood or scarcely even popularly
explained. In the light of the full unfolding of "Credits"
in our Fourth Chapter, and in the light of these simple
principles now under discussion, there will be no great
difficulty to any intelligent reader in fully understanding
this matter of Foreign Exchange,&mdash;a matter never before
so vital to the commercial interests of the United States
as now. For the sake of general illustration we will take
the "Exchange" as between the United States and Great
Britain, since the same fundamental principles apply as
between all commercial countries.</p>

<p>When merchants export goods, say from New York to
London, or <i>vice versa</i>, they do not wait for their pay till
the goods be actually marketed abroad, but draw at once
Bills of Exchange to the amount of the home value of the
goods on the parties to whom the goods are sent, and then
put these bills on present sale with brokers or middlemen
at home. There thus becomes a market or prices current
in New York for commercial bills drawn on London, and
similarly a market in London for bills drawn on New York.
The New York exporter, accordingly, is not certain of
getting in money the full face of his bill <i>minus</i> interest
for the time it has to run, because a great many such
exporters may have thrown their similar bills upon the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[469]</a></span>
market the same day, which always tends so far forth to
depress the price of the bills in accordance with an universal
law of Economics. Scarce is ever costly: plenty is
ever cheap.</p>

<p>Who buys these bills when exposed for sale in New
York? Who wants them? Clearly, only those who have
commercial debts to pay in London. A bill of exchange
drawn in New York on London is nothing but a debt due
from somebody in London to anybody whom the drawer
in New York chooses to make the payee. The debtor
lives in London, and it is every way cheap and convenient
for all parties, that he settle his debt with a creditor living
in London. So it happens, that parties in London who
have sold goods in New York and drawn bills on them for
present payment, expose those bills for sale in London to
the parties who have debts to pay in New York. If now,
London or those whom London represents in these transactions,
have sold but few goods to New York or to those
whose business is settled in New York relatively to the
amounts sold by New York to London, then London bills
will be relatively scarce as compared with the New York
bills drawn on London. In other words, New York has
more debts to pay in London than London has in New
York, and, consequently, the parties in London who want
bills to pay New York debts with, have to buy them in a
relatively scarce market. They have to <i>bid</i> for them, as it
were. The effect of this is always to carry up the price of
that, for which the buyers are many and the sellers relatively
few. So, under perfectly natural causes, London
bills on New York come to a premium; that is to say, the
London sellers get more than the face of their bills drawn,
and the trade with New York becomes <i>extra</i> profitable to
them.</p>

<p>Suppose London bills of Exchange on New York are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[470]</a></span>
selling for 101, thus giving 1% extra profit to English
exporters; for precisely the same reasons that they are so
selling, New York bills on London are selling in New
York for 99, thus subtracting 1% from what would otherwise
be the gains of the New York exporters to England
under the common principles of Foreign Trade. It is
evident, therefore, that the causes of the course of the
international Par of Exchange are an essential part of the
principles of foreign Commerce; and whatever tends to
derange or upset the natural course of the Par, as a
constant or constantly recurring cause, must receive careful
attention in a book like the present. We have begun
at the very beginning of this matter, and we are now going
to follow it up to the very end.</p>

<p>The Diversity of relative advantage in the Production
of the two commodities exchanged, is the first and chief
ground of mutual Profit in foreign trade; the varying
Intensity of relative Desire on the part of each exchanger
for the product of the other, is the second and secondary
ground on which foreign trade must go on; and the third
and final difference as between the two parties, which goes
to make or mar the profit of each of them in the trade, is
the current Price of the Bill of Exchange drawn by each
creditor on his debtor abroad. It is plain that these three
things must always be taken into account simultaneously
by prudent exporters and importers, in order to estimate
the prospect of a profitable trade then and there; and it is
plain also, that one or even two of these three differences
of relative advantage might fade out for a time, and a
profitable trade still proceed, provided the other two or
one of these differences were sufficiently pronounced. For
example, to take an extreme case, silks from France might
still go to England for cottons to the advantage of both
countries for a time, though "exchange" were exactly at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[471]</a></span>
"par" between them and the "demand" for silks were precisely
met by the "demand" for cottons, on the strength
of a marked and persistent diversity in relative cost of
production of the two textiles.</p>

<p>Here is another of the trinities of Political Economy.
Here is complication indeed, but a complication regulated
and beautified by inflexible laws of Nature and the scarcely
less inflexible laws of human Motives.</p>

<p>So far the argument has proceeded on the supposition of
a common standard of Value, say gold, between England
and France, London and New York, and by implication all
other commercial countries. Commerce rejoices in, and
progresses by, a common measure of Values. By an experience
of 2000 years the world has proven gold to be the
best international Measure. From a simple comparison of
the weights of pure metal in the standard coins of the
nations is established a fixed monetary "par" as between
them. Thus the dollar of the United States contains 23.22
grains of pure gold, and the English pound sterling contains
113.001 grains of the same; consequently, there are
$4.8665 to the £ sterling, and this is and has been since
1834 the monetary "par" between the United States and
Great Britain. Similarly, the par between France and the
United States is $1 to 5 fr. 18 centimes, since the franc is
19.29 cents gold for gold. The monetary par, accordingly,
as between any two nations using the gold standard, is a
matter easily ascertained and kept in mind; while the
constantly variable prices current of Bills of Exchange are
reckoned in and from this monetary par. Thus, if a commercial
bill drawn in New York on London sells for
$4.8665 <i>minus</i> current interest for the time it has to run,
English "exchange" with us is said to be at "par"; if it
sell for more than that, exchange is technically said to be
"<i>against</i>" us, although the excess in price is just so much
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[472]</a></span>
additional profit to the American exporter; and if it sell
for less than that, exchange is said to be in our "<i>favor</i>,"
although the difference is just so much subtracted from the
gains of the American exporter.</p>

<p>The close of the second week in July, 1890, found in
New York "Sterling exchange dull but firm, with actual
business at $4.84&#190; for 60-day bills and $4.89 for demand
bills: the posted rates were $4.85&#189; and $4.89&#189; respectively."
Exchange, accordingly, had turned "against" the United
States, that is to say, American exporters could get a little
more for their bills on London than the monetary par.
Under such circumstances it may be cheaper to send the
gold to liquidate a British debt than to buy bills and send
<i>them</i>. Just this happened last week: $2,000,000 in gold
went (mainly under this impulse) from New York to
London. There is a limit, therefore, to any further rise in
the price of "exchange," when it reaches in an upward
direction the then present cost of sending gold to foreign
creditors. The limit in the downward direction to the
price of exchange is the last margin of profit to the exporter
as such. Thus, when the New York exporter can only
get, say, $4.83 for his sight bill of exchange on London,
his loss in the trade so far forth is 1%; and it may be
doubtful, whether his possible gains at the other two points,
namely, relative cost of production and relative intensity
of demand, will overbalance this certain loss and leave a
sufficient margin of profit.</p>

<p>This chance of profit or loss from casual turns in the
commercial "exchanges" is a very small matter in foreign
trade in comparison with the other two grounds of possible
profit or loss. The main thing for every commercial nation
to see to is, that it have at least a few (the more the better)
commodities in general use throughout the world, <i>in the
cost of the production of which it has a relative advantage</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[473]</a></span>
<i>over all competitors, and the demand for which by foreigners
is relatively intense and constant</i>. And it will never come
amiss for any nation with these two crucial advantages to
keep a sharp watch over a class of its own citizens, lest
they, shrewdly and greedily, for special reasons of their
own, get laws passed the result of which can only be <i>to
increase the costs of production of these few exportables, and
at the same time lessen the foreign demand for them</i>. <span class="smcap">Eternal
vigilance is the price of liberty of commerce.</span></p>

<p>As a general rule for the last half century commercial
"exchanges" have been "against" Great Britain, that is,
her exporters have been able to get more than "par" for
goods sent abroad in the price of the bills drawn on them,
and her commerce has been <i>profitable</i> to her so far as this
cause is concerned; which during the same interval of
time the "exchanges" have been "in favor" of the United
States, that is, her exporters have been obliged to sell their
bills drawn for less than "par," and her commerce so far
forth has been <i>unprofitable</i> to her. We may only briefly
indicate here the causes of this state of things.</p>

<p>(a) Great Britain has been during this period a vast
loaner of Capital to other countries, and particularly to
the United States; while the United States has been a vast
borrower of Capital, particularly from Great Britain. The
interest on these loans from Britain, and the principal also
so far as it has been repaid, has been constantly remitted
thither in goods for the most part, and bills of exchange
drawn on these goods have been sold at all ports, and particularly
at New York; the abundance of these bills has
tended of course to lower their price at the place of sale,
and so far forth to heighten in effect the relatively less
abundant British bills drawn on exports thence; and the
<i>creditor</i> country for this reason is apt to sell its bills above
"par," and the <i>debtor</i> country its bills below par. It makes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[474]</a></span>
no difference at this point how the borrowed funds have
been invested by the borrowing country, since the interest
and the principal must be repaid at some time chiefly in
the manner just indicated.</p>

<p>(b) With the exception of a dozen or two articles customs-taxed
for simple revenue, Great Britain in this period
has kept her ports absolutely open to imports from all the
world, and of course to all imports from the United States,
which has tended to swell the volume of imports into that
country, and the volume of foreign bills drawn on them,
particularly of United States bills; while the United States
during the same time has excluded imports by customs-taxes
designed for that very purpose, to the number of over
4000, and in many cases to a height of tax involving prohibition
of import. The Constitution of the United States
expressly forbids customs-taxes upon exports, so that goods
may indeed go out freely, so far as tariff-barriers are concerned;
but as the only impulse that ever carries goods
<i>out</i> is to get <i>back</i> more desirable goods in pay, and as these
return-goods are greatly restricted or virtually prohibited
by the United States, the Constitutionally-free exports are
not large enough to help much in keeping down below
"par" the price of bills of exchange drawn here. It should
also be said that Great Britain is restrained in her exports
to the United States by the latter's legal unwillingness to
receive them, which tends of course to keep the price of
bills drawn on the exports she can and does send still more
above "par."</p>

<p>(c) The enormous customs-taxes in the United States on
ship-building materials and on almost everything else have
practically destroyed the ocean merchant-marine of the
country. The bulk of the Freights, therefore, on what
foreign commerce there is left to us under the Chinese-wall
policy of our Government,&mdash;the bulk of the freights both
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[475]</a></span>
ways,&mdash;has to be paid to foreigners, mostly to the British,
and these payments too are made in exportable goods,
which wretched fact (looked at in its causes) increases
exports hence relatively to imports hither, and of course
diminishes <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pro tanto</i> the current price of mercantile bills
drawn here. So far as these <i>extra</i> exports to meet freight
charges are carried to England, they tend to lift there in
the usual way the price of bills drawn on British exports.
It is a million pities, no matter from what point of view
one looks at it, that the present governing classes of this
country totally misapprehend the Nature of foreign trade,
and by short-sighted legislation minimize its Benefits to the
people.</p>

<p>So far we have been unfolding the causes and courses of
foreign exchange on the hypothesis, that both the nations
exchanging employ the same standard in measuring Values.
While the present paragraphs were in process of composition,
the President of the United States signed (July 14,
1890) the so-called "Compromise Silver Bill," which is to
go into operation after thirty days, and the effect of which
in the judgment of some of the best economists and financiers
of the country <i>may be</i> to bring down the national
measure of Values from the gold dollar to the silver dollar.
We are bound at this point, therefore, to explain the action
and reaction on the course of the "exchanges," of a monetary
standard lower in general value than the standard
prevailing in the commercial world. We have all the data
needful for clearing up this matter completely, at once in
the inflexible laws of Money and in the actual experience
of several of the Nations. For example, England has the
gold standard, and India the silver standard; there is an
immense commerce between the two countries; silver is
merchandise and not money in London, and gold is merchandise
and not money in India; every cargo, accordingly,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[476]</a></span>
to and from either has to have its value "changed" through
the price of current bills into the current money of the
other country; the price of silver in gold in London (average)
between 1852 and 1867 was 61<sup><big>1</big></sup>&frasl;<sub><big>3</big></sub> pence per ounce; at 60
pence per ounce the ratio of gold to silver is 1:15.716;
between 1875 and 1882 silver drooped (with many
fluctuations) in the London market, bearing about the
average of 52<sup><big>1</big></sup>&frasl;<sub><big>3</big></sub> pence per ounce, which is a ratio with gold
of 1:18; during the first half of 1890 the price of silver in
London was as nearly as possible 43 pence per ounce,
which is a ratio with gold of 1:21.93; so that, the prices
of India bills in London and of London bills in Bombay
have yielded up to the careful observer all the secrets of
the "exchanges" between high-standard and low-standard
countries.</p>

<p>But we have no need to go out of our own country for
illustrations of all this. Between May, 1862, and January,
1879, the "Greenback Dollar" was the measure of current
Values. It was depreciated every day of that interval
as compared with the gold dollar, and it fluctuated in the
comparison more or less nearly every business day. The
New York importer bought his foreign goods for gold,
paid the customs-taxes on them in gold, and then sold
them against greenbacks. How much must he charge for
his goods in order to make himself whole? The current
premium in gold over greenbacks was posted every day,
and perhaps every hour, but was that a safe guide to
greenback prices for our importer? Wholesales are rarely
for immediate realization in money, and even if they were,
the money would have to be rechanged into gold in the
future for repurchases abroad. In the uncertainty of
greenback values, the importer must <i>insure himself</i> in his
prices to-day against a possible further depreciation next
week, or next month. In other words, <i>he must speculate</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[477]</a></span>
<i>in the prospective gold premium</i>. Suppose his industrial
cycle to be one month. If he sell his foreign goods in
greenbacks to-day as these stand in comparison with gold,
and greenbacks fall still lower before the month is out,
he will lose money in those transactions; if greenbacks
should rise in the interval, he would gain money, because
he could get more gold for them in the next turn. To
the credit of human nature be it said, that in 9 cases out
of 10 a merchant will raise the present prices of his goods
in order to make himself as sure as possible in a case where
all is uncertain. There can be no reasonable doubt that
in the fifteen years of depreciated greenback units, retail
prices to ultimate consumers were lifted 10% above the
average reckoning of goods in greenbacks from this cause
alone.</p>

<p>In regard to exports at that time the facts and principles
are still clearer. These exports were sold in Europe for
gold. But the bills of exchange drawn on them were sold
in New York for greenbacks. Take wheat, for example,
of which there was a large export in all those years. The
New York broker or banker in buying these bills was obliged
to make the conversion from greenbacks to gold. He had to
estimate as well as he could what the value of greenbacks
would be when the gold-bill became payable in London.
In other words, he had to speculate in greenbacks, because
he had to take the risk of their declining or advancing
value for an interval of time, say, one month. He would
not take this risk without virtually making a charge sufficient
in his judgment to cover it, and leave him a good
profit in any case. This charge came out of the price of
the wheat ultimately paid to the growers thereof. The
bill of exchange was sold in New York or Chicago in
order to get present pay for the farmers who furnished the
wheat, and present profit for the commission-merchants or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[478]</a></span>
middlemen. But the bill brought less greenbacks than
the quoted premium on gold would warrant for that day,
on account of the risk, the uncertainty, the speculation.
Therefore, less went to the farmers for their wheat per
bushel or centner. <i>The masses of the people lose the immense
losses of that depreciated money.</i> And during these
very years also the Government put customs-taxes to a
then unheard-of height on imports from abroad, not primarily
for the sake of the revenue to come from the taxes,
but chiefly with a view to keep certain foreign goods out
of the country altogether, in order that <i>some</i> citizens might
be able to sell their own product <i>to the rest</i> at artificially
enhanced prices. Thus the natural market abroad for
wheat and pork and petroleum and other provisions was
enormously lessened by the prohibition of imports,&mdash;a
market for products is products in market,&mdash;at the same
moment when the actual prices for products exported were
still further diminished by the action of depreciated money
on the par of commercial exchange.</p>

<p>Our neighboring Republic of Mexico has had for a long
time the so-called bi-metallic standard of Money, the same
as the United States have had.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
When the great fall of
silver in gold took place in the London market as indicated
above, gold was rapidly exported from Mexico, and soon
disappeared from circulation, in accordance with Gresham's
Law. For many years now the simple silver standard has
prevailed in Mexico. Its entire working in foreign trade
through the "exchanges" has been sufficiently demonstrated;
and as there is more than a possibility, more even
than a bare probability, that the United States under the
law of 1890, and other and earlier extremely complicated
laws of Money, may drop from bi-metallism to silver monometallism
in the near future, in the way of premonition
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[479]</a></span>
and warning to our own people we may fitly close our
discussion of foreign "Exchanges" by briefly stating what
of hazard and disaster under the silver standard is now
going forward among our neighbors to the southward.</p>

<p>The effect of estimating Mexican transactions in silver
money, while all the nations with which they trade estimate
theirs in gold, is seen in an artificial enhancement
of prices to the Mexicans on all their imports, and an artificial
depression of prices to them on their exports. Look
first at imports. There is of course a current discount on
Mexican silver as compared with the gold in which the
imported goods are bought. This discount is now over
20% throughout the commercial world, the London price
of silver in gold giving the key to that song. But this is
not all by any means; the discount is variable from day to
day and from month to month; in changing his gold prices
present into silver prices future, the Mexican importers
must insure themselves. This necessitates a speculation
in the future of silver. What the risk may be will depend
somewhat on the activity of the silver market: if silver be
rapidly fluctuating in price, the importer will add more to
his silver prices additional to the current premium on
gold, than if silver be comparatively stable; but in all
cases he will add enough to cover all prospective risks. It
is quite likely that five <i>per centum</i> is added on the average
to wholesale prices by Mexican importers on this ground
alone, which addition with all the usual increments must
be borne by retail and ultimate prices.</p>

<p>Now look at Mexican exports. The larger part in value
of these exports is silver in some form, mostly in the form
of silver dollars. But these silver dollars are merchandise
in London, and quite variable in price there, as has already
been shown; and bills of exchange drawn on this silver in
any form, and sold in Mexico to parties remitting gold
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[480]</a></span>
values to London, are subject to constant depression on
account of the uncertainty as to the value of silver in gold
when the bills reach London. It follows from this, that
the use of the silver standard in Mexico actually depresses
the value of silver there. By means of the "exchanges"
both ways, silver tends to be still further depreciated in
comparison with gold, retail prices of all importables
enhanced in silver, and the chief exportable (silver) depressed
in value all the while! Truly, the Mexicans are
between the upper and nether millstones. Poor Money
never pays.</p>

<p>In confirmation of this fact that Mexico has not lifted
the relative value of silver by making it the sole Measure
of Value, we have the corresponding fact that the herculean
efforts of the United States since 1878 to advance the
value of silver to a parity with that of gold in the legal
ratio of 1:15.98, have issued in the constant relative
decline of silver here; and, what is more surprising, in an
almost constant increase of the yearly production of silver
here. The following table tells the whole instructive
story: the figures are official: commercial "fine ounces"
are .915 of technically "fine" silver.</p>

<p>These Seven, then, are the essential Principles of Foreign
Trade, brought out, it is hoped, as clearly and consecutively
as the relative and complicated nature of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[481]</a></span>
transactions will allow; in the light of these Principles it
is very clear, that Foreign Trade is just as legitimate as,
and may be more profitable than, Domestic Trade; that it
rests on the same ultimate and unchangeable grounds in
the constitution of Man, and in the Providential arrangements
of Nature; that the Profit of it is mutual to both
parties, or it would never come into being, or, coming into
being, would cease of itself; that to prohibit it, or restrict
it, otherwise than in the interest of Morals, Health, or
Revenue, must find its justification, if any at all, wholly
outside the pale of Political Economy; and that for any
Government to say to its citizens (of whom Government
itself is only a Committee), who may wish to render commercial
services to foreigners in order to receive back
similar services in return, that such services shall neither
be rendered nor received, is not only to destroy a Gain to
both parties, but also to interfere losingly with a natural
and inalienable Right belonging to both.</p>

<p>If the reader pleases, we will turn now, in the second
place, to the <span class="smcap">Methods and Motives in vogue to restrict
and prohibit Foreign Trade</span>. The instrument
for this purpose is called a <i>Tariff</i>. The origin of the word
Tariff, its nature and kinds, will throw much light upon
what has been a vexed question, but is one easily solvable,
and indeed long ago resolved.</p>

<p>1. Origin.&mdash;When the Moors from Africa conquered
Spain in the year of our Lord 711, they fortified the southernmost
point of the peninsula where it juts down into the
Straits of Gibraltar, and by means of their castle and town,
called in their Barbary language <i>Tarifa</i>, compelled all
vessels passing through the Straits to stop and to pay to
these Moorish lords of the castle a certain part (determined
by themselves) of the value of the cargoes. This payment
appears to have been blackmail pure and simple; it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[482]</a></span>
was certainly extorted by force; and whether there were
any pretence of a return-service in the form of promised
exemption from further pillage or not, that made no real
difference in the nature of the transaction. Eleven centuries
later, the United States demonstrated what they
thought about similar extortions on American commerce
practised in the same waters by the descendants of these
same Moors, by despatching Commodore Decatur with a
strong fleet to Algiers and Tunis and Tripoli; to which
piratical states they had already paid in twenty-five years
two millions of dollars in "tribute" or "presents" for
exemptions of their Mediterranean commerce from plunder;
who captured the pirate ships and compelled the
terrified Dey of Algiers (and the rest) to renounce all
claim thereafter to American "tribute" or "presents" of
any kind. The word <i>Tarifa</i>, accordingly, in English and
other modern languages, a word which seems to be very
dear to some men's hearts, does not appear to have had a
very respectable origin, though that is not sufficient of
itself to condemn the thing described by the word. That
will depend upon its nature and purposes.</p>

<p>2. Its nature.&mdash;There never was one particle of doubt
on the part of those compelled to pay the Moorish demands
at Tarifa, or on the part of the United States compelled
to pay "tribute" to the Algerines for a quarter of a century,
about the <i>nature</i> of the transaction. The sign at
Tarifa was <i>minus</i>, and not <i>plus</i>. To the credit of those
pirates let it be said, that they never pretended to take
what they took for the <i>benefit</i> of those from whom they
took it. They took it for their own benefit. The action
was abominable, but it was aboveboard. There was no
deceit and no pretence about it. Both parties knew perfectly
what was going on. What was delivered was just
so much <i>out</i> from what would otherwise have been the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[483]</a></span>
<i>gains</i> of the voyage. And the truth is, the thing, tariff, is
always true to the origin of the word, tariff, so far as this,
that a tariff always <i>takes</i>, and never <i>gives</i>. The only
phrase a tariff speaks, or can speak, is, <i>Thou shalt pay</i>!
There is lying open on the table of the writer at this moment
a stout volume of 417 pages, printed, with nearly
as many more interleaved, entitled Tariff Compilation,
published by the United States Senate in 1884, containing
every item of all the tariffs passed by Congress from
1789 to the present time. One may read this volume
from beginning to the end, or he may read it from the end
backwards to the beginning, or he may begin in the middle
and read both ways, and all he will find between the
covers is a series of <i>Demands</i> made upon somebody to
<i>pay</i> something. These demands, of course, are made
upon, and realized from, the citizens of the United States,
who are the only people under the authority and jurisdiction
of the Congress. A tariff, then, may be correctly
defined as <i>a body of takings or taxings levied upon the people
of any country by their own government on their exchanges
with foreigners</i>. How anybody can intelligently suppose
that a body of <i>taxes</i>, which their own countrymen will
have <i>to pay</i>, can be so cunningly adjusted as to become to
them a positively productive agent, a blessing and enrichment
to the payers, a spur to the progress of their Society,
<i>they</i> may be properly called upon to explain who pretend
to believe such an absurdity in the nature of things.</p>

<p>3. Its kinds.&mdash;There are two kinds of Tariffs under our
general definition, very diverse from each other in their
respective purposes, principles, incidence, and results.</p>

<p>(1) There is a tariff for Revenue. The sole purpose
of a revenue tariff as such is to get money by this mode of
indirect taxation out of the pockets of the People for the
coffers of the Government, in order to be then expended,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[484]</a></span>
governmentally, for the general benefit of those who have
paid the money in for that single end. The underlying
thought of this kind of tariff, a tariff for revenue only, is,
that the Government itself shall get all the money which
the people are obliged to pay under these taxes, except the
bare cost of collecting them; that only <i>such</i> taxes shall be
levied at all as will come bodily and readily into the general
Treasury for public uses; and no intelligent and justice-loving
people will long tolerate tariff-taxes laid with any
other intent than the economical support of their government,
or laid in any other way than shall bring into the
Treasury all that is taken out of the People. A Revenue
Tariff, therefore, may be properly defined as <i>a schedule of
taxes levied on certain imported goods with an eye only to
just and general taxation</i>.</p>

<p>There are three vital principles on which a revenue tariff
as such must always be levied. (a) As the sole object is
to get money for the national treasury, and as money can
only be gotten as the foreign goods taxed are allowed <i>to
come in</i>, such taxes must be levied at <i>a low rate</i> on each
article taxed, so as not to interfere essentially with the
bringing in of that class of goods with a profit to the importers,
and not at all to encourage the smuggling of them
in. (b) A varied experience of all the commercial nations
has shown, that it is not needful in order to derive a large
and growing revenue to lay even low rates on <i>all</i> goods
imported, but only on certain classes of them, so as to
burden at as few points as possible the successful ongoing
of international exchanges; since the prosperity ever induced
by commercial freedom enables a country to import
and to pay for in its own quickened products vast quantities
of the articles subjected to the tax, so that large revenues
come from low rates levied at few points. Here we
lay bare the ground of a great income in the exemption
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[485]</a></span>
of the bulk of imports from any tax at all. (c) Custom-taxes
should be laid wholly or at least mainly on articles
procured from abroad, and not also produced at home;
for otherwise the incidence of the tax on the portion imported
will necessarily raise the price also of that portion
made or grown at home; and thus the people will pay <i>more</i>
money in consequence of the tax than the Government
<i>gets</i> from the tax in revenue. Three points, then, in a revenue
tariff, namely, <i>low duties on few articles, and these
wholly foreign</i>.</p>

<p>The best modern example of a purely revenue tariff is
that of Great Britain since 1860. All duties are on one or
other of the following sixteen items, namely, Beer, Cards,
Chiccory, Chocolate, Cocoa, Coffee, Fruit, Malt, Pickles,
Plate, Spirits, Spruce, Tea, Tobacco, Vinegar, and Wine.
Of these, Spruce yielded no revenue in 1880; Cards, Malt,
Pickles, and Vinegar, yielded in the aggregate that year
only £1.491; leaving the other eleven items to furnish
practically all the customs revenue; but of these Coffee
and its three substitutes with Beer and Plate, furnished
only £337.258, so that, the remaining five articles yielded
£18.915.489, or 98% of the whole income in 1880. In
other words, Fruit, Spirits, Tea, Tobacco, and Wine,
brought in all but 2% of the customs-taxes of Great
Britain in 1880. In 1890, the duties on certain Wines
and Spirits having been lifted, there was a large surplus of
revenue over the Estimates, which has just been devoted
to the enlargement of the Navy. Every other European
commercial country had a deficit that year as compared
with its Estimates of the year preceding. The figures are
not now at hand for an exact statement, but there can be
little reasonable doubt that the "Five Articles" rendered
at least 98&#189;% of the tariff-taxes of England last year. If
there be also some domestic production of any article taxed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[486]</a></span>
by the British tariff, a corresponding excise-tax on that
part produced at home, which part would otherwise be
raised in price by the tariff-tax to no advantage of the
Revenue, enables that Government to get easily all that
the people are made to pay in consequence of the tariff-tax
on the imported part.</p>

<p>(2) There is a tariff under Protectionism so-called. The
ruling aim in this second kind of tariff is not at all to
obtain income for Government in order to promote the
general good, but on the contrary by means of heavy taxes
on <i>foreign</i> articles to raise the prices of corresponding
<i>domestic</i> ones for the exclusive benefit of a few producers
of these home goods at the expense of all home buyers of
them. If these special tariff-taxes be so high and complicated
as to keep out altogether the foreign articles, and so
the Treasury realize nothing at all from the taxes on them,
so much the more "protectionist" do they become, and
so much the better pleased are the special domestic producers
with the entire monopoly of the home market at
their own prices. Such taxes are prohibitory and protectionist
at the same time. Prohibition is the perfection of
Protectionism. A Protectionist Tariff, accordingly, may
be justly defined as <i>a body of taxes laid on specified imported
goods with a single eye to raise thereby the prices of certain
home commodities</i>.</p>

<p>The vital points of a protectionist tariff are also three,
but these are the exact opposites and antipodes of the
three points of a revenue tariff, so that it is self-contradictory
and impossible to combine in one tariff-bill the two
sets of contrary elements. A revenue tariff with incidental
protectionism is a solecism. (a) If a tariff-rate is to be
protectionist in character, that is, competent to raise the
price of home products, it must be <i>high</i>, so as either to
exclude altogether the corresponding foreign products, in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[487]</a></span>
which case there is no revenue at all, or else to make their
price by means of the duty added reach the point at which
the home producers plan to sell their own, in which case
there will be very little revenue. For instance, when the
Bessemer steel companies asked in 1870 for two cents a
pound tariff-tax on foreign steel rails, they called it in terms
in their "confidential" statement to the Ways and Means
"<i>exceptional protection</i>," and admitted in so many words
that they expected to supply the home market entirely,
and so the Government would get <i>nothing</i> in revenue and
the people be compelled to pay $44.80 <i>extra</i> for their home
steel rails per ton. It is a little bit of comfort to think,
that they only obtained $28 per ton, or 1&#188; cents per pound,
which was not quite prohibitory, so that the Government
got a little revenue on steel rails, and the people paid for
some years only about <i>double</i> for their rails what they were
worth in a free market! To reach its end a protectionist
tariff-tax must be <i>high</i> of necessity.</p>

<p>(b) No system of protectionist tariff-taxes can be entered
upon or continued in any country except by means
of many persons who all alike want their special products
artificially lifted in price by legislation, and who are
obliged <i>to combine</i> in order to get and keep what they
want, so that protectionist taxes on a few things only
were rarely or never found in a tariff; so contrary are
such taxes to the common sense and common interests of
man, that only strong combinations of many special interests
can begin or maintain them, whence there must be
<i>many</i> taxes if any under this strongly selfish scheme; and
by an actual count of them by the writer in 1868 there
were found to be 2317 distinct rates of tax assessed on
different foreign articles in the Tariff of the United States,
which was strikingly in contrast with the Revenue Tariff
of Britain in point of the number of things taxed. So
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[488]</a></span>
needful is log-rolling to the maintenance of protectionism,
that the passage of the "knit-goods bill" in the summer
of 1882, for example, was contingent on the contemporaneous
passage of the famous "River and Harbor bill" of
that year.</p>

<p>(c) While Revenue Taxes select by preference things
wholly imported, Protectionist Taxes are placed of course
on such foreign goods as are also and especially made or
grown at home, otherwise their plain and sole purpose
would be thwarted, which completes the contrast between
the two kinds of tariffs. For illustration, Tea and Coffee
are the best things possible to tax in a tariff for revenue,
because (1) they are in universal consumption, and (2)
they are wholly imported, and taxes upon them do not
raise the price of anything else, and so the Government
gets all that the people pay under them; for this very reason
the taxes upon Tea and Coffee, which had yielded for
years some $20,000,000 of revenue yearly, were thrown off
in 1872 under protectionist leadership, by the deceptive
cry of "<i>a free breakfast table</i>," in the subtle interest of
commercial bondage; seeking to give the impression on
the one hand that everything on the breakfast table was
to be free, whereas nothing on it or around was to be free
except the two beverages mentioned, and on the other
hand that the removal of these two taxes was a great boon
to the people, whereas the motive for the removal of these
was <i>to continue</i> on the people burdens tenfold heavier.
Eighteen years have rolled away since then, and Tea and
Coffee are still upon the free list; the incompatibility of
the two kinds of tariff-taxes is demonstrated in the fact,
that there has not been for years a single tax primarily for
revenue in the United States tariff,<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
the opposite protectionist
idea having logically wrought itself out there; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[489]</a></span>
the same incompatibility is shown in the British tariff, in
which there has been no protectionist tax since 1860.
Each aim logically carried out completely excludes the
other aim.</p>

<p>The best and worst specimen of a protectionist tariff
that the world has ever seen, has been in operation in the
United States for thirty years, 1861-1890. Its inner history
is not yet fully known by the public, but enough is
known to expose the motives and to condemn the action
of all those, whether constituents or congressmen, who
knowing what they were doing, contributed to build up
gradually that mass of incongruities and iniquities, under
which the entire agricultural class of the country (nearly
one-half of the people) has become impoverished, by much
the larger part of the farming lands of the Union covered
by heavy mortgages, and the ocean-marine of a naturally
nautical people almost totally destroyed. Attempts more
or less successful have been made at various times and at
different points to conceal from the Public the impulses
really behind the provisions of this tariff, and even the
amount and the mode of the incidence of its taxes; many
of the most protectionist taxes have been complex, combining
upon the same article <i>specific</i> and <i>advalorem</i> rates,
as for instance, upon blankets "<i>50 cents per pound and
35% advalorem</i>," so that it was difficult or rather impossible
for the common reader or buyer to ascertain how much
the tariff-tax really was; much of the language of the
tariff-bills has been to the last degree involved and uncertain,
often leading to perplexing disputes and costly litigations,
and sometimes covering up a half-hidden purpose;
importers have been bribed, as it were, in cases of doubtful
legality, to pay the maximum rates demanded, by the prospect
and promise that the extra sums if ultimately found
by the courts illegal should be repaid bodily <i>to them</i> and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[490]</a></span>
not to the people who in the mean time had bought and
paid for the goods thus enormously enhanced in price,
and millions of the people's money have gone back in that
way to importers and to spies and informers; a careless
wording in tariff-descriptions has again and again covered
goods not designed to be touched, as the lastings and rubber
webbings of the shoemakers to the consternation of
that great interest, which asked for no protectionist privilege
for itself, but wanted its raw materials at their natural
price; and the iron industry of Pennsylvania was bitterly
angry at Secretary Sherman, who construed a line of the
tariff relating to cotton ties used at the South more favorably
to the planters than to the iron-workers, although the
latter were strongly privileged at every point of the tariff
(even at this) in the teeth of the interests of the consumers
of iron, and the later honorable ambition of the
Secretary to become a candidate for the Presidency of the
United States was largely thwarted in consequence by
the hostility of these miserable and revengeful monopolists.</p>

<p>There were fifty descriptions of iron and steel taxed by
the tariff in 1879, and the average rate of tax on these
at that time was 77% <i>advalorem</i>, and this was about the
average rate for the thirty years under the consideration.
On special articles of prime necessity and universal consumption,
as steel rails, the tax varied under the rate of
$28 per ton put on in 1870 from 85% to 100% <i>advalorem</i>;
and the purpose of this particular tax was plainly seen in
an average price of domestic steel rails in this country
$24.44 a ton higher than in England for better rails under
a longer guarantee for the eleven years, 1870-80; in other
words, 87% of the tax paid on the smaller and better part
imported was added to the average price of the larger and
worser part produced at home during those eleven years.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[491]</a></span>
That the English rails were better and even regarded as
cheaper under their guarantee with the $28 a ton added
to their price, is proven by the fact that the N. Y. Central
railroad company relaid their tracks with the English rails,
and were putting them down in Detroit in plain sight of
simultaneous track-laying across the river in Canada, where
the same kind of English rails were costing $28 a ton less.
Every passenger and ton of freight carried by steel-track
roads in the United States in this interval contributed his
and its share to make up to the roads this <i>extra</i> price paid
for steel rails. In 1883 the tariff-tax on steel rails was
reduced to $17 per ton. That this enormous artificial price
of iron and steel products under tariff-taxes redounded
wholly to the profit of the capitalists concerned, and not at
all to the benefit of the laborers concerned, is shown by the
Census of 1880, which gives $393 as the average pay for
that year of the persons employed in the iron and steel
industries of the country; and the late Senator Beck of
Kentucky demonstrated on the floor of the Senate, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">nemine
contradicente</i>, that only 8.8% of the value of the products
of the Bessemer steel industry in 1881 went to the laborers
employed in it, while 66.9% of the same went to the capitalists
as profits. Let the thoughtful reader remember at
this point, that iron and steel products are only one of an
indefinite number coddled and privileged by the tariff at
the expense of the masses of consumers.</p>

<p>It is impossible to tell exactly <i>how much</i> more the people
of the United States were compelled to pay for their commodities
under tariff-taxes, whose ground-thought was to
compel them to pay more and the more the better, than the
Treasury received as the direct product of these taxes
during 1861-90, but an approximation can be made within
the truth whose results are fitted to startle the minds of all
good citizens. For convenience' sake only, and because the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[492]</a></span>
official figures are complete for the shorter period, let us
take for comparison the twenty years, 1863-82. The
annual average tariff-income for those 20 years was in
round numbers $158,000,000; but the ground-thought of
the tariff-scheme in all those years was not to get an
income for Government, but factitious prices for capitalists
privileged by law; and during the last half of the time
there were no tariff-taxes on Tea and Coffee, which had
been before the principal revenue taxes. If, now, we may
fairly suppose, that for each <i>one</i> foreign article paying a
tax into the Treasury there were <i>four</i> domestic articles
raised each in price as much as the foreign article paid
in customs-tax, then it follows, that the People paid in
each of those 20 years under customs chiefly protectionist,
$632,000,000, or $12,640,000,000 in all, no penny of which
went into the Treasury of the United States. That this
supposition of 4:1 is wholly reasonable, appears partly
from the known proportion (officially reported) between
Domestic and Imported as to several leading articles, for
example, of steel rails in 1880 the Domestic was 20 times
the Imported, and the People paid 19 times more under
the tax than the Treasury got; and on woollen blankets
in 1881 the Treasury took in less than $2000, while the
People paid in the <i>extra</i> price of blankets more than 1000
times that sum that year; and on iron and steel goods of
all kinds the average tariff-taxes were about 77% in that
interval of time and the vast bulk of the iron and steel
goods consumed was boasted to be of domestic production.</p>

<p>Let us confirm these striking results by another more
than reasonable supposition taken from the opposite quarter.
The census of 1870 gave $4,232,000,000 as the value
of home manufactures for that year, which we may fairly
take as the average of the 20 years under consideration;
now, if we throw off one-third of those home
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[493]</a></span>
products as not affected by the tariff at all, and reckon
that the rest were only raised in price 22%, which was
only one-half of the average rate of tax on dutiable goods,&mdash;the
average rate on these was officially pronounced in
1880 at 44%,&mdash;then almost precisely the same results will
follow as before: two-thirds of $4,232,000,000 is $2,880,000,000,
and 22% on that sum is $633,600,000. An acknowledged
statistical expert of national reputation, Mr.
J. S. Moore, calculated from data quite diverse from our
own, that the People paid $1,000,000,000 in the one year,
1882, <i>extra</i> to the sum reaching the Treasury that year,
under protectionist tariff-taxes. We see, then, clearly the
<i>methods</i>, by which Protectionism reaches its ends, and we
cannot but conclude, that these methods issue in monstrously
unjust burdens on the masses of the People.</p>

<p>It remains, under this second general head, to examine
the <i>motives</i> of those men, who have gotten the protectionist
tariff-taxes put upon the different classes of imported goods
in this country. Fortunately we have data of unquestionable
authority, covering the entire first century of our
national existence, which prove these two propositions:
first, <i>that no protectionist tax has ever been</i> <span class="smcap">put on</span> <i>by our
Congress from the first day until this day except at the
instance and under the pressure of the very men personally
and pecuniarily interested to secure thereby an artificial rise
of price for their own domestic wares</i>; and second, <i>that these
very men have been almost, if not quite, as active and determined</i>
<span class="smcap">to keep off</span> <i>protectionist taxes on other goods used
by them in their processes of production, whether raw material,
machinery, or accessories</i>. These two propositions,
taken together, demonstrate beyond a cavil the motives of
the protectionists as a class. Of course, they have had
their dupes and tools. Out of their own mouths and out
of their own actions are they to be judged. One hundred
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[494]</a></span>
years is long enough of time in order to display perfectly
the motives of a prominent and persistent class of men,
under that Government of the world, whose key-note is
Exposure, and under that maxim of the world, Actions
speak louder than words.</p>

<p>Thomas H. Benton, a United States Senator from Missouri
for 30 years, 1820-50, himself in all that time a
prominent leader and debater, and always an indefatigable
investigator, published an <i>Abridgment of the Debates in
Congress from 1789 to 1856</i> in 15 large volumes. Each
important tariff Debate for the first 70 years of our national
history is distinctly brought out in these volumes, and the
impulses and motives behind each leading speaker may be
discerned as clear as day. The present writer has been
over these debates with great care, and has mastered them
in their substance and motives on both sides; and he has
been besides a deeply interested reader and excerptor of
all Congressional tariff-debates for more than 30 years
just past; and now invites his present readers to take a
cursory glance over this broad field, and satisfy themselves
as to the motives personal and associate of the protectionist
debaters from the first to the present time.</p>

<p>Because the new Constitution prescribed that "<i>all bills
for raising revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives</i>,"
the main debates on the first tariff-act of 1789
were in that branch of the national Legislature. Nothing
could be simpler or sounder than the basis of the new
tariff as proposed by Madison, the acknowledged leader
in the debates, namely, the so-called Revenue System of
1783, as adopted by the old Congress, and ratified by all
the States in succession, excepting New York. That was,
small specific taxes on eight articles, namely, Wines,
Spirits, Tea, Coffee, Cocoa, Molasses, Sugar, and Pepper.
In the earlier part of the discussion no other end than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">[495]</a></span>
revenue was mentioned in connection with the taxes.
Madison said: "<i>I own myself the friend of a very free
system of commerce: if industry and labor are left to take
their own course they will generally be directed to those
objects which are most productive, and that in a manner
more certain and direct than the wisdom of the most enlightened
legislature could point out; nor do I believe that
the national interest is more promoted by such legislative
directions than the interests of the individuals concerned.</i>"
It is significant of after times that the first word in this
debate respecting any other word than revenue through
the tariff-taxes came from Pennsylvania; and equally
significant, that the next and strongest words for something
else than revenue came from Massachusetts; and
more significant than either was the junction of the two
States in influence and votes when it came to the final
adjustment of the actual tariff-rates. Pennsylvania had
already gotten well forward in the manufacture of iron
and steel products, particularly of nails, and wanted "<i>encouragement</i>,"
that is, protectionist taxes upon the foreign
products corresponding. Said Hartley of Pennsylvania:
"<i>I am therefore sorry that gentlemen seem to fix their mind
to so early a period as 1783; for we very well know our
circumstances are much changed since that time: we had
then but few manufactures among us, and the vast quantities
of goods that flowed in upon us from Europe at the conclusion
of the war rendered those few almost useless; since
then we have been forced by necessity, and various other
causes, to increase our domestic manufactures to such a
degree as to be able to furnish some in sufficient quantity
to answer the consumption of the whole Union, while others
are daily growing into importance. Our stock of materials
is, in many instances, equal to the greatest demand, and our
artisans sufficient to work them up even for exportation. In</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">[496]</a></span>
<i>these cases, I take it to be the policy of every enlightened
nation to give their manufactures that degree of encouragement
necessary to perfect them, without oppressing other
parts of the community.</i>"</p>

<p>Massachusetts was not a whit behind Pennsylvania in
asking for discriminations in her own favor at the obvious
expense of the rest of the country. New England rum
was made out of molasses, and Jamaica rum was its competitor
in public favor; distillers in the neighborhood of
Boston and Salem wanted therefore a <i>high tax</i> on Jamaica
rum, and a <i>low one</i> on the imported molasses used in the
home manufacture. Madison was willing to discourage
rum-making and rum-selling both in the interest of temperance,
and proposed a tax of eight cents a gallon on molasses
and fifteen cents on Jamaica rum, which called out this indignant
burst from Goodhue of Massachusetts: "<i>Molasses
is a raw material, essentially requisite for the well-being of a
very extensive and valuable manufacture. It ought likewise
to be considered a necessary of life. In the Eastern States
it enters into the diet of the poorer classes of people, who
are, from the decay of trade and other adventitious circumstances,
totally unable to bear such a weight as a tax of eight
cents would be upon them. I cannot consent to allow more
than two cents. Massachusetts imports from 30,000 to 40,000
hogsheads annually, more than all the other States together.
Fifteen cents, the sum laid on Jamaica spirits, is about one-third
part of its value: now eight cents on molasses is considerably
more: the former is an article of luxury, therefore
that duty may not be improper; but the latter cannot be said
to partake of that quality in the substance, and when manufactured
into rum is no more a luxury than Jamaica spirits.</i>"</p>

<p>The Senate in the First Congress sat with closed doors,
and was thus more open than the House to the influence
of interested petitions which soon began to pour in upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">[497]</a></span>
it, asking for amendments to the House bill in the line of
protectionism; and through such amendments the Massachusetts
and Pennsylvania members, with a few other
members similarly inclined, partially carried their points
into the first Tariff. The tax on molasses was fixed at 2&#189;
cents a gallon, and on Jamaica rum at ten cents a gallon;
nails were taxed one cent per pound imported; and an
accepted Senate amendment classed Hemp and Cotton
together as two products of the soil worth "encouraging,"
hemp at <sup><big>3</big></sup>&frasl;<sub><big>5</big></sub> of a cent per pound and cotton at three cents a
pound; yet hemp constantly "encouraged" to this day at
the cost of ship building and other industries has never risen
to the rank of a staple. Coal was also taxed protectionistly,
at the instance of Virginia, then the coal-producing
State. Note the three universal features of Protectionism
in the original application of it to the United States;
(1) the purely selfish call to tax one's neighbor in order
to lift the price of one's own wares (nails), (2) the equally
selfish resistance to such a tax as falls on one's raw materials
(molasses), and (3) the final log-rolling among those
legally privileged at different points (Massachusetts and
Pennsylvania and Virginia).</p>

<p>Take a second instance of the same general point from our
second Tariff, passed in 1816. Two Massachusetts young
men, Lowell and Jackson, brothers-in-law, had started a
modern cotton-mill in Waltham, near Boston, in 1813, and
constructed in it, with the help of an ingenious mechanic
named Moody, a power-loom; as soon as the war with England
was over, and Congress in consequence began to talk
about a new Tariff, Lowell went to Washington, and by
personal influence with Mr. Calhoun, then the leading man
in the House, with Mr. Lowndes his colleague from South
Carolina, who afterwards reported the new bill, and with
other members of Congress, contributed largely to the introduction
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">[498]</a></span>
into this Tariff of protectionist features towards
<i>cottons</i>. Lowell struck strong at the start. He represented
(doubtless with entire honesty) to Calhoun and
Lowndes, both from a cotton-planting State, that a domestic
market for raw cotton <i>in addition</i> to the foreign market
would raise the price of that agricultural staple. Both
were easily convinced that such would be the case, although
both found ample reasons afterwards for altering their
opinion in that regard. Lowell, the "cotton city" on the
Merrimack, founded in 1821, was named from the successful
lobbyist of 1816. Lowndes reported a tax on cottons
of 33<sup><big>1</big></sup>&frasl;<sub><big>3</big></sub>% <i>advalorem</i>, with a proviso <i>that all cottons should
be assumed at the custom-house to have cost at least 25 cents
to the square yard</i>. This was the famous principle of the
"<i>minimum</i>," a device to increase the protectionism without
<i>seeming</i> to do so.</p>

<p>The debate on this feature of the bill was a marvel in
many ways. The penetrating reader will not be at a loss
for the reason of this. John Randolph moved to strike
out from the bill the proviso for the cotton <i>minimum</i>, and
argued at some length "<i>against the propriety of promoting
the manufacturing establishments to the extent and in the
manner proposed by the bill, and against laying up 8000
tons of shipping now employed in the East India trade, and
levying an immense tax on one portion of the community to
put money into the pockets of another</i>." Calhoun rejoined:
"<i>Until the debate assumed this new form, he had determined
to be silent; participating, as he largely did, in that general
anxiety which is felt, after so long and laborious a session, to
return to the bosom of our families. It has been objected to
that bill, that it will injure our marine, and consequently
impair our naval strength. How far it is fairly liable to
this charge, he was not prepared to say. He hoped and
believed it would not, at least to any alarming extent, have</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">[499]</a></span>
<i>that effect immediately; and he firmly believed that its lasting
operation would be highly beneficial to our commerce.
The trade to the East Indies would certainly be much
affected; but it was stated in debate that the whole of that
trade employed but six hundred sailors. The cotton and
woollen manufactures are not to be introduced: they are
already introduced to a great extent; freeing us entirely
from the hazards, and in a great measure, the sacrifices
experienced in giving the capital of the country a new direction.
The restrictive measures and the war, though not
intended for that purpose, have by the necessary operation of
things turned a large amount of capital to these new branches
of industry. But it will no doubt be said, if they are so far
established, and if the situation of the country be so favorable
to their growth, where is the necessity of affording them
protection? It is to put them beyond the reach of contingency.</i>"</p>

<p>Thus Calhoun goes on, making the greatest mistake of
his life which he regretted to his dying day, to give
plausible reasons for his insistence and his vote, but he
does not even touch upon the <i>real reason</i>. If he had
detailed his conversations with Lowell, it would have
been far more to the point. His motive, like that of
every other man in Congress who has urged protectionist
schemes, was the special benefit of some of his constituents
at the more or less concealed expense of their countrymen.
But, as always happens when men really act
from unavowed motives, he was suspected of having them;
and he guarded himself: "<i>He was no manufacturer; he
was not from that portion of the country supposed to be
peculiarly interested. Coming as he did from the South,
and having in common with his immediate constituents, no
interest but in the cultivation of the soil, in selling its products
high, and buying cheap the wants and conveniences of</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[500]</a></span>
<i>life, no motives could be attributed to him but such as were
disinterested.</i>" But Randolph still charged, that the discussion
showed "<i>a strange and mysterious connection</i>"
between this measure and the National Bank bill which
had just passed. This was a loophole of escape for Calhoun:
"<i>he wished merely to reply to the insinuation of a
mysterious connection between this bill and that to establish
the Bank. He denied any improper or unfair understanding,
and could challenge the House to support the charge.</i>"</p>

<p>A beautiful instance of the <i>confession</i>, which all protectionists
make in action when it comes to the pinch, that
a rise of price is at once the object and the result of protectionist
tariff-taxes, is found in the awkward attempt
of Congress to relieve indirectly the burnt-out citizens of
Chicago in 1871. The great fire occurred in October of
that year. In the winter following a bit of legislation
took place in Congress in consequence, which is too instructive
to be passed by without notice, because in all
the parts of it taken together we have in epitome the
motives and the processes and the prompt confessions of
Protectionism. Contributions were taken up all over the
country, and even in Europe, for the relief of the people
of Chicago. As Whittier puts it:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"From East, from West, from South and North,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The messages of love shot forth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, underneath the severing wave,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The world, full-handed, reached to save."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But cannot Congress do something to help rebuild the
ruined city? April 5, 1872, President Grant set his signature
to a congressional bill enacted to last one year only,
and for the express benefit of Chicago alone, <i>to exempt all
building materials except lumber from the operation of tariff-taxes</i>.
As a public and emphatic confession on the part of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[501]</a></span>
Congress, that tariff-taxes raise the prices of protectionist
goods, and that the remission of such taxes lowers the
prices of such goods and becomes a boon to the buyers, all
this is refreshing and satisfactory; but why was <i>lumber</i>,
by much the most important of the building materials
needed, <i>excepted</i> from the bounty of the legislators to the
unfortunates of Chicago? The bill applied to Chicago
only, and was to last but one year at best! The bill as
drawn and debated included <i>all</i> building materials. Why
was lumber excepted? Because, while the bill was still
pending, a special car filled with the lumber-lords of
Michigan and Wisconsin was rolled to Washington in
haste, and the potent influence of these men was sufficient
to cause the express exemption of their product from the
intended cheapening (for one year) of the building materials
for desolated Chicago. The brief official record of
this curious transaction will be found in U.S. Statutes for
1872, page 33. It needs no comment but the obvious one,
that here is the whole matter of protectionism in a nutshell;&mdash;the
motive, the open confession, the greedy lobby
determined to thrive on their neighbors' misfortunes, the
inhumanity, the spirit of monopoly, the infernalism,&mdash;a
game of grab from beginning to end!</p>

<p>Shameless as the protectionist debates in Congress have
been from the start, in letting it be plainly seen, that the
sole motive of their efforts is an artificial rise of price in
certain goods which their fellow-citizens would be compelled
under the law to pay, the debate in the House of
Representatives in the spring of 1883 was by far the most
shameless and avowed in this respect of any that ever
transpired there. In the last days of that debate all pretence
of any action for the good of the country at large
dropped utterly out of the discourse: the old fallacies and
disguises and subterfuges of "home markets" and "higher
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">[502]</a></span>
wages" and "commercial independence" were no longer
put forward even in word under the clash of selfish interests,
and in the eagerness to secure for their wares a factitious
price to be paid by their countrymen; proposed
reductions in tariff-taxes were fought off by these men,
and in many instances still higher taxes were urged on,
under their unabashed avowal that, unless home prices
were thus stiffened and uplifted, they could not make and
sell their wares at a profit; one honorable member from
New Jersey brought his pottery wares upon the floor of
the House, and tried to demonstrate to his fellow-members
that, unless these very goods were hoisted in price, by
taxes on his foreign competitors, he could no longer tread
his clay and work his wheels with profit to himself: in
other words, he and others like-circumstanced, by lobbying
and log-rolling, persuaded Congress to pass so-called laws
to compel their countrymen <i>to hire them to carry on what
they publicly alleged were unprofitable branches of business</i>.
By their own confession, the only trouble with their goods
was, that they were inferior in quality and superior in
price to otherwise similar goods in the open market of the
world.</p>

<p>One more, and the latest instance, out of hundreds
equally accessible and equally conclusive, will suffice for a
demonstration of the point in hand. In the early summer
of 1890, a Massachusetts member of the House of Representatives,
an avowed protectionist from an alleged protectionist
district of that State, waxed so warm in arguing
against a protectionist tax upon a certain raw material
useful in tanning leather, that he took off his coat and
proceeded in his shirt-sleeves! One would suppose, both
from his zeal and the tenor of his speech, that he was a
veritable free-trader! But no! He had argued a hundred
times that protectionist taxes (to be paid by other people)
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">[503]</a></span>
were a good thing for the payers, and enriched the whole
country; but lo! it turned out in this case that he himself
was a buyer of this particular material, and lo! he did not
relish the tax-lifted prices caused by the tariff. They were
all wrong. They must be fought off at all hazards, even
in the hottest weather! This is a very respectable gentleman,
well thought of by his neighbors in Worcester
County, but his protectionism is <i>not</i> respectable. It is
chameleon-colored. It is one thing in one light, and an
opposite thing in another light. Indeed, the protectionist
congressman has never yet been discovered in this country,
who was fond of paying protectionist taxes himself, or
willing that his immediate and powerful constituents
should pay them! It has been proven many times over,
that the very strongest friends of a Free List in this broad
land have been certain so-called protectionist Senators and
Representatives.</p>

<p>From these few sample-examples, the reader of penetration
will perceive, that there is no element of logical
coherence or moral decency or even outward respectability
in Protectionism. There is no <i>principle</i> in it or of it. It
does not hang together. It walks in darkness and not in
light. It is full of deceit. It is fond of disguises. It is
contrary to common sense. It offends justice. Morality
frowns at it. It has no basis in any Science, least of all in
the Science of Buying and Selling, whose best impulses it
feebly tries to deny, and whose largest and most innocent
gains it fain would destroy.</p>

<p>Next in order we will examine, in the third place, a few
of the chief <span class="smcap">Fallacies and Falsehoods</span>, by which Protectionism
has striven to give itself a standing in the
commercial world. In our day at least, these are, without
exception, afterthoughts and subterfuges. We have just
seen under the last head the real impulses, plain as a mountain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">[504]</a></span>
peak, which put on and keep on and pile up these taxes
on the masses of the people; but these real motives will
not bear inspection and public criticism, and so plausible
reasons must be found or at least propounded, which shall
do the double duty of covering the real reasons, and of
seeming to convince while they only perplex the victims
of the scheme. These plausibilities we propose now to
analyze and to expose. The test of any alleged truth is its
harmony with acknowledged truths: the test of any propounded
error is its incongruity with and contradiction of
acknowledged truths. On a logical comparison, therefore,
of any false proposition with any known truth, the latter
will be sure to fling out its flat contradiction and floor the
falsehood forever. Protectionism contradicts economic
truths at practically innumerable points, but we will now
watch the collisions at the principal points only.</p>

<p>Fallacy A: <i>that a nation may still sell to foreign nations
while prohibiting the buying from them</i>. Protectionism is
multiplied prohibitions on the buying of goods from
foreigners. Between four and five thousand of such
prohibitions deface our national Statute-book at the present
moment. All the while, however, the assumption underlies
this policy, and the express proposition is often heard
in different forms along the lines, that our citizens may still
sell their products to foreigners, nevertheless. England
has <i>got to buy</i> our cotton or starve: the Continent <i>is compelled</i>
to take our pork products, for they are the cheapest
food in the world: how can China or India <i>help</i> taking the
silver from our mines? Softly. Buying and selling from
the very nature of it is never compulsory, but always
voluntary. A commercial service is never rendered but in
plain view of a return-service to be received. The mental
estimation of each buyer is couched in the very terms of
what is offered in return by each seller. Buying and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">[505]</a></span>
selling from its inmost nature is always one act of two
persons acting conjointly and inseparably to the advantage
of each. How, then, can the individuals of one country
<i>sell</i> anything to individuals of another country without at
the same instant <i>buying</i> of these in return? The act of
selling is just as much buying as it is selling, and the act
of buying is just as much selling as it is buying. As we
have abundantly seen already, the introduction of Money
as a <i>medium</i> in the transaction makes no difference in the
<i>nature</i> of the exchange of commodities internationally.
The postulate, therefore, that the people of one country
can continue to sell products to the people of another while
refusing to take their products of some kind in return, is
an <i>absurdity</i> in the nature of things and an <i>impossibility</i> in
the world of facts. <i>A market for products is products in
market.</i></p>

<p>All known facts confirm this irrefragable reasoning, and
discredit utterly the fallacy in hand. When France and
Germany a few years ago gave back to our protectionists a
dose of their own medicine, and prohibited American pork-products,
ostensibly because they feared the trichinæ but
really to cajole their own farmers under the plea of protectionism,
their brethren in the faith have made up all sorts
of faces ever since, have wound up the respective diplomatic
clocks to strike twelve against the too presumptuous
countries which ventured to restrict American products
in their ports, have protested and proclaimed. What is
the matter? Is not sauce for the goose sauce for the gander
also? Have not American protectionists shut out French
and German products 100:1 under the same plea now
used on the Continent? "<i>But we cannot sell our products
abroad</i>," cry the angered Western farmers. Of course they
cannot, because restrictions on buying <i>are</i> restrictions on
selling; and additional restrictions of the same kind put
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">[506]</a></span>
on French and German buying are of course still further
restrictions on American selling. And the farmers are, as
usual, the victims both ways.</p>

<p>To hear an ordinary American protectionist talk, one
would think that Great Britain is the enemy of mankind
for admitting into her ports practically without let or hindrance
the goods of all the world. <i>Free Trade England!</i>
Let us look a moment. England has to pay for all these
goods received from all quarters. In what does she pay?
In her own goods, of course. What is her market? The
whole world. Is that market ever slack on the whole?
Never. Is she ever flooded with cheap goods? The more
she buys the more she sells of necessity. How much does
she sell <i>per capita</i> of her people? More than twice as
much as the United States sells <i>per capita</i>. How can she
sell so much of her own stuff? Because she buys freely
other stuff from all the world. What are the limits to her
capacity to sell her own goods to foreigners? Precisely
the limits of her willingness to take in pay other goods
from foreigners. Cannot these limits be overpassed in
either direction? By no possibility: when people can no
longer pay for what they buy, the buying ceases; and
when they are not permitted to take their pay for what
they sell, the selling ceases. Is this free trade profitable
to Great Britain? Immensely so in every way. Whither
has it carried up her ocean-marine? To the topmost notch.
Is capital abundant in England in bulk, and are its loanable
rates low? England is the richest country in the
world, and all nations resort thither to buy. What is the
source of this vast volume of Capital? The only source
of Capital is savings from the natural gains of Buying and
Selling.</p>

<p>Is Great Britain willing to take in goods from the United
States? Certainly, under the universal conditions of taking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">[507]</a></span>
in foreign goods at all. Is the United States willing to
take in British goods in pay for her own goods exported
thither? She is not, except over protectionist barriers
averaging 47%. Is it a good thing for the United States,
that Great Britain takes in her goods freely? We should
suppose so! Does the former already sell to the latter and
through the latter more goods than to all the world besides?
Much more. Could this profitable trade be easily increased?
It could be quadrupled in a very short time. How? By
simply according to our citizens a decent liberty, which is
their inalienable right. Would the United States like it to
be commercially treated by Britain exactly as the former
treats the latter? It would bankrupt the United States in
six months. Would our protectionists like it? It would
make them howl. Is it the commercial salvation of the
United States that Britain is immovably for free trade with
her and the rest of the world? Nothing else saves her
from commercial ruin. Can the ghost of a reason be given,
commercial or other, why the United States should continue
to fling double fists into the face of British goods
seeking a market and so making one? Not a shadow of a
shade of a good reason was ever given for such folly, or
ever can be.</p>

<p>It is more than a pleasure to acknowledge at this point
the great service done by James G. Blaine, Secretary of
State, during the summer of 1890, to Country and Commerce,
by his courageous avowal contrary to his own personal
record and to the vehement behest of his party, that
the economic principle just enunciated is sound, and should
be at once applied by the United States in connection with
all the countries of Latin America. In a letter to the
Senate on the results of the recent Pan-American Conference,
he said: "<i>The Conference believed that while great
profit would come to all the countries, if reciprocity treaties</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">[508]</a></span>
<i>could be adopted, the United States would be by far the
greatest gainer.</i>" The principle of reciprocity is the principle
of free trade applied by both parties to the trade. It
is the sound principle, that goods buy goods and pay for
goods at the same instant to a mutual profit. Manifold
reiterations of this principle came from the Secretary that
summer, especially in vigorous protestations against the
McKinley tariff-bill then pending, alleging with truth that
"<i>there is not a line or a section in the bill which opens a
market for another bushel of wheat or another barrel of
pork</i>." The unequivocal statements of a favorite statesman
have roused the somewhat indifference of thousands
of citizens, and make certain the speedy prevalence in the
United States of the unassailable doctrine, that any People
must buy freely if they would sell broadly.</p>

<p>Fallacy B: <i>that tariff-taxes are needful in order to start
infant industries</i>. There is no analogy whatever between
Child-bearing and Child-growing and any form of Buying
and Selling at any time, but the deceit in the wretched
simile has cost the world billions of dollars of pure loss.
To bring up infants from birth to maturity is indeed a
good deal of a task for the parents, but it is not in any
sense an economical task: the parents neither ask for nor
receive a return-service in kind: the transaction is wholly
moral in its character, and not economical at all: there is
no party of the second part in the premises: there is a
free giving, and that is all. Buying and Selling, on the
contrary, has no infancy, and no maturity and no old age.
This particular Minerva springs at once full-grown and
full-armed from the brain of Jove. The conditions of
Trading are forever the same; with no reference to the
age of the parties, the antiquity of the industry, or any
other such irrelevant thing. If any person anywhere (old
or young) has got something to sell, and finds (directly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">[509]</a></span>
or indirectly) any other person anywhere who wants his
wares and can pay for them,&mdash;all the conditions of mutual
profit are present, and everything else is an impertinence.</p>

<p>Much more than this. Tariff-taxes have to be paid by
somebody. Their payment is inexorable at the custom-house,
and interest and other charges are added before the
sum reaches the ultimate payer. But the ultimate sum
however made up is exactly so much <i>out</i> of the commercial
gains of the payer. The sign is every time <i>minus</i> and <i>not</i>
plus. When egregiously high tariff-taxes are multiplied
in number, and all the additions are made to them, they
become an incalculably large sum, every cent of which <i>has
to be paid</i> out of the gains of current Industry. Now,
what a queer way that is to foster industries! What a
queer way to help start them! It takes Capital to start
new industries, and to carry on old ones; but tariff-taxes
(with all their accretions) take just so much <i>out</i> from
what would otherwise naturally become Capital. That is
to say, all Capital is savings from the gains of Exchanges;
and these gains are <i>reduced</i> by every tariff-tax that touches
them directly or indirectly. Taxes from their very nature
can help nobody. They hurt everybody. What a device
this is to start new industries with, namely, to pick the
pockets of the very men, who are to start the industries,
if they ever are to start at all! Lower your reservoir to
begin with, in order to give head and force to your faucet
flow!</p>

<p>But this is not half of it. On what industries do the
protectionist taxes fall at first to weaken and discourage
them? Of course on the natural and profitable ones,
which only ask to be let alone in order to maintain a
healthful life and growth. If, under natural conditions,
any industry is in existence, one may be perfectly sure it
is profitable, since Profit is the only thing in the world
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">[510]</a></span>
that can start and build up an industry: when the profit
ceases, the trade ceases of necessity: the motive to it is
<i>gone</i>. In behalf of what sort of industries are these taxes
ostensibly and plausibly levied? Only, if we are to believe
the protectionists, the weak and presently unprofitable
ones. <i>It is the infant industries that need the nursing-bottle!</i>
That is to say, tax down and perhaps destroy the <i>profitable</i>
industries, the industries that <i>pay</i>, that can paddle their
own canoe and no thanks to anybody, in order to bring
forward certain other industries, which by confession and
open proclamation are <i>unprofitable</i>, and can only <i>start</i> by
taxing their neighbors! Of course, there is a cat in this
meal, and we shall let her out of the bag in plain sight
presently; but we are taking now our friends, the protectionists,
at their own word, and exhibiting their marvellous
wisdom under the terms of their own choosing.
What a blessed way for a nation to grow rich, to smite
down with high taxes the active and enterprising and
independent and therefore profitable industries with one
hand, and grope around with the other to find some poor
and inactive and unfrugal and naturally unprofitable industries,
in order to fetch forward these by means of the
plunder filched from the others!</p>

<p>To go back for historical illustration to Washington's first
administration, when the first (extremely mild) protectionist
taxes were levied in this country, we have the highest
authority for knowing that many of the leading branches
of manufactures were prosperous and profitable. They
had no artificial help in order to start, but on the contrary
had had continual discouragement for a century under
the miserable protectionist policy of the mother country.
Washington himself was inaugurated in a dark brown
suit of woollen cloth of American manufacture: so was
John Adams inaugurated first Vice-President of the United
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_511" id="Page_511">[511]</a></span>
States about the same time in a garb of wholly native
manufacture.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
This was in April, 1789. In November of
the same year, Washington returned to New York from
his first tour in New England "<i>astonished both at the marvellous
growth of commerce and manufactures in New England
and the general contentment of its inhabitants with the
new government</i>" (Schouler, p. 117). Alexander Hamilton,
the first Secretary of the Treasury, in his famous Report
to Congress on Manufactures, in 1791, enumerated seventeen
branches as then thriving so as to fairly supply the
home market, and settle into regular trades. These were,
skins and leather, flax and hemp, iron and steel, brick and
pottery, starch, brass and copper, tinware, carriages, painter's
colors, refined sugars, oils, soaps, candles, hats, gunpowder,
chocolate, snuff and chewing tobacco. It is plain
enough from the debates of the time as well as from the
nature of the case, that the protectionist taxes in our first
two Tariffs, already considered here in detail, although
they were comparatively slight in number and amount,
fell in the way of discouragement on these incipient yet
independent manufactures as well as upon all the farmers
of the land. There can be but little rational question,
that the woollen industry was sounder at the core in 1789,
when Washington was inaugurated in native woollens,
than in 1889, when Harrison was inaugurated in the same,
the ostentatious gift of a firm of protectionist woollen
manufacturers shortly afterwards adjudged to be bankrupt
and fraudulently so.</p>

<p>The best point, after all, to make against this hollow
fallacy, is the practical one, that no industry whatever,
whether "infant" or other, has ever come in this country
into an acknowledged self-sustaining position under a
whole century's tariff-taxes. Salt, hemp, coal, cottons,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512">[512]</a></span>
woollens, nails, and iron and steel products generally, were
the chief articles protectionized at first, and have been protectionized
ever since, but no one of them all has ever
come into a condition of self-support according to the view
of the privileged beneficiaries. Each one of them was an
old industry, and a relatively rich industry, when it was
taken under the "fostering care" of the tariff-taxes, levied
for their further enrichment on the masses of the people;
and it was only greedy and secret combinations among
these for that purpose, which put them at first and has
kept them ever since in the rank of public beneficiaries.
The simple truth is, that diversity of employments is
rooted in human nature and in the circumstances amid
which God has placed men, and so far is it from being
true that taxes and restrictions are needful in order to
foster manufactures, taxes and prohibitions cannot prevent
them from springing into life! They are just as natural
to men and to colonies as agriculture is. Indeed, agriculture
can scarcely take a step without them. The farmer
must have ploughs and carts and other implements; and,
depend upon it, there are some natural mechanics in that
colony. Clothes are as needful as food, and spinning and
weaving in some form will begin at once, and prohibitions
will be powerless to stop them.</p>

<p>Deadly to the fallacy in hand is the word of unquestionable
History. Any one may read in Palfrey and Bancroft
and Hildreth such facts as these, scattered all along
through the noble volumes. The manufacture of linen
and woollen and cotton cloth was begun in Massachusetts
in 1638, in Rowley, by some families from Yorkshire; and
became so remunerative in a couple of years that some
acts of the General Court designed to stimulate it were
repealed. Brick-making and glass-works and the manufacture
of salt were all begun in Massachusetts before 1640.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">[513]</a></span>
In 1643, the younger Winthrop established iron-works in
Braintree and Lynn, which after some losses were successfully
prosecuted. Within less than twenty years thereafter,
tannery and shoemaking had made such strides, that
boots and shoes became articles of export. That these
were no fancy beginnings in manufactures, we may strikingly
learn from an Act of Parliament passed in 1698.
Notice the date. This law is a sample of many more:&mdash;"<i>After
the first day of December, 1699, no wool, or manufacture
made or mixed with wool, being the produce or manufacture
of any of the English plantations in America, shall
be loaden in any ship or vessel, upon any pretence whatsoever,&mdash;nor
loaden upon any horse, cart, or other carriage,&mdash;to
be carried out of the English plantations to any other
of the said plantations, or to any other place whatsoever.</i>"
Thus the fabrics of Massachusetts were forbidden to find
a market in Connecticut, or to be carried to Albany to
traffic with the Five Nations. "That the country which
was the home of the beaver might not manufacture its own
hats, no man in the colonies could be a hatter or a journeyman
at that trade, unless he had served an apprenticeship
of seven years. No hatter might employ more than two apprentices.
No American hat might be sent from one plantation
to another." In 1701 the three charter colonies are
reproached by the lords of trade "<i>with promoting and propagating
woollen and other manufactures proper to England</i>."
In 1721 New England alone had six furnaces and nineteen
forges, and there were many others in Pennsylvania
and Virginia. Parliament enacted in 1750 that no more
mills should be erected in America for slitting or rolling
iron, or forges for hammering it, or furnaces for making
steel; and in certain cases, agents of the crown were authorized
to tear down such establishments as "<i>nuisances</i>."
How far all the arts of navigation had been carried in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">[514]</a></span>
Colonies before the Revolution, every one may read in
Burke's famous speech on Conciliation with America.
How far the products of the loom, the forge, and the anvil,
were already being exported, in spite of British legislation,
to other countries, any one may see in Lord North's last
proposals and concessions to ward off Independence.</p>

<p>Protectionism having once fed its petted beneficiaries
from the public crib, that is to say, from taxes wrenched
from the many to enrich the few, invariably clamors for
more and more rations for its pets from the same public
source. Not only does no industry become self-supporting
by its bite and its sup, but each becomes according to its
own facile representations and representatives, more and
more helpless in itself, more and more shameless in its
demands, more and more <i>entitled</i> to public charity, and
less and less inclined to surrender one iota of past or
present privilege. The daughters of the horse-leech cry
continually, Give! Give! The following schedule relates
to woollens mainly, but it is a fair sample of many other
protectionized classes of goods under the successive tariffs
in this country, in point of increased taxes on the people
in their behoof. While these lines are being written, the
McKinley tariff-bill, so-called, having passed the House, is
pending in the Senate. It is significant, that this piece of
legislation, whether it be finally enacted or not, proposes
to open the second century of the United States Protectionism
by largely hoisting the tariff-taxes along the main
line. Infant industries indeed!

<p>It is also significant in this connection to read an extract
from the Report of Mr. William Whitman, President of
the National Association of Wool Manufacturers, dated
March 29, 1890, to the Stockholders of the Arlington
Mills, Massachusetts. "<i>I have been your Treasurer for a
consecutive period of twenty years. During this period the
average earnings have been 20&nbsp;<sup><big>8</big></sup>&frasl;<sub><big>10</big></sub>
per centum upon the capital.
The earnings of the last year were nearly three and a
half times those of the year previous, and there is every
indication that the current year will be the most profitable
one in the company's history.</i>"</p>

<p>Fallacy C: <i>that a home market is better and broader than
a foreign market</i>. Professor Thompson of Pennsylvania has
publicly and repeatedly stated, that, by a persistent policy
of Protectionism a "home market" would be created for
all the bread-stuffs that this great country produces; and
John Roach, the shipbuilder, expatiated at length before
the Tariff Commission of 1882 on the advantages the
farmer derives from the better "home market" already
created by Protectionism. To come nearer home in place
and further down in time, there was organized in Eastern
Massachusetts with headquarters at Boston in some connection
with the national election of 1888, a so-called
"Home Market Club" of large proportions. It is generally
understood in the State, that a large minority, if not a
majority, of the members, are displeased with the McKinley
Bill of 1890, declaring that the mustard is carried to
fanaticism in this bill, that neither the "home market"
nor any other can profit by such a series of prohibitions.</p>

<p>However this last may be, it is plain, that a ridiculous
and most harmful fallacy underlies all references to a
"home market" in any connection with foreign trade. It
is simple Gospel charity to believe, that Thompson and
Roach and the founders of the Home Market Club and all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_517" id="Page_517">[517]</a></span>
others, who repeat this wretched stuff, never stopped in
their thoughts long enough to inquire what a "market"
really is, never analyzed into its simple elements that composite
thing called a "market," but each and all in turn
have taken up a catch-word carelessly which seems on the
surface to have some significance though in reality it has
none.</p>

<p>All will agree, if they will stop to think, that a "market"
is always made up of <i>buyers</i> with return-services
in their hands. A bigger home market than before consists
only in more domestic buyers than before, all ready
with acceptable pay in all their hands. More persons
than before, more services-in-return than before. Now, if
Protectionism <i>can enlarge the home market</i>, it must be
(1) either by increasing the number of births or diminishing
the number of deaths in a given time in a given country.
Precisely how big bundles of big taxes, which the
whole population must pay in one form or another and over
and over again, may be made to stimulate births or prolong
lives, no reasonable man can see, and it is not unreasonable
to deny that a protectionist can see it. But conceding
that he can see and show this, his task is then but half
done, for he must proceed to see and show how these same
onerous taxes are able (2) to multiply the return-services
in the hands of this increased population!</p>

<p>If he think at all, the protectionist is compelled to
remember, that his system is always and everywhere a
series of prohibitions on profitable trade. A profitable trade
always gives birth to gains. It always gives birth to Capital.
It always gives birth to Plenty. That is the nature
of it, and the Divinely ordained blessing on it. But when
the greater part of these gains are artificially cut off, when
the possible capital is reduced in volume, when the scarcity
comes in which is the primary <i>purpose</i> of Protectionism to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_518" id="Page_518">[518]</a></span>
create, it shall go hard if there be even as many return-services
as when the process began. Not a better "home
market," but a more meagre one, is the inevitable issue of
restrictions and prohibitions.</p>

<p>If our protectionist try to get out of this snug place, in
which he now finds himself, provided he is able to feel the
force of any logic whatever, by claiming that his broader
"home market" is to be made by new immigrants with
old-world values in their hands to buy with, he certainly
cannot escape by this route, because (1) he must in order to
do this see and show what there is in big taxes enormously
multiplied to invite immigrants here at all; and (2) our
typical protectionist is scared to death by the <i>handiwork</i> of
foreign "pauper labor" wherever exposed for sale, and of
course he is not prepared to welcome the pauper laborers
themselves, of which class as described by him the immigrants
would mostly consist; and besides, the tariff would
not admit to our shores the old-world values, which would
be the immigrants' sole <i>return-services</i> to help make up the
new market!</p>

<p>Within a week of the present writing, Senator Morrill of
Vermont has broached from his place the idea in debate,
that the industries of the United States can be so stimulated
by protectionism as to cause the consumption of all
the agricultural products of the United States. Well,
when? The stimulus has been applied now just thirty
years under Mr. Morrill's own eye, and by a tariff called
by Mr. Morrill's own name, increasing its rates every little
while, even in 1883, when the public pretence was to
diminish them; and agricultural products of all kinds,
including lard and pork and wool, have never been so
"deadly dull" as in this interval of high protectionism.
Scores of thousands of bushels of well-ripened Indian corn
were burned for fuel in the more western States and Territories
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_519" id="Page_519">[519]</a></span>
the very last winter, because the market for it was
too poor to pay for its transportation to Chicago over
protectionized rails, and in cars built of tariff-cursed
lumber, every nail and bolt and screw in which doubled in
price from the same general causes. If Mr. Morrill were
not in his dotage, or if in his prime he had ever closely
analyzed a single case of trade, foreign or domestic, he
would see that the abandoned farms of his own State
reckoned to be about one-third of the cultivated land on
the eastern slope of the Green Mountains to the Connecticut
River,&mdash;Mr. Morrill's own native region and residence,&mdash;abandoned
farms for two years past assiduously sought by
State officials to be filled in if possible by immigrants from
Sweden virtually giving them the lands and farm-buildings,&mdash;fling
out their flat contradictions to this senatorial
drivel; that the constant decline for a quarter of a century
of the farming population in every State in New England
gives the lie to this miserable proposition; and that the
constantly increasing area of mortgaged farms in every
agricultural State in this Union is an overwhelming proof
that the "home market" for farm staples has been growing
constantly worse for years under this boasted protectionism.</p>

<p>The year 1890 is likely to prove the pivotal point of
time in the swing of this whole proposition of Deceit, for
two reasons, namely, (1) it is the year of the decennial
Census, in which at least a half-hearted attempt is being
made to bring out the aggregate area in each State of the
mortgaged farming lands, and nothing can prevent the
appearance in which of the lessening volumes of population
in the purely agricultural communities; and (2) the year
has already been marked by the political revolt from the
party of protectionism of the masses of the farmers in the
Mississippi Valley, and their organization into "Farmers'
Alliances," naturally and demonstrably hostile to all Restrictions
on the sale of farmers' produce.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_520" id="Page_520">[520]</a></span></p>

<p>Fallacy D: <i>that protectionism tends to raise the wages of
general laborers</i>. In our third chapter, the whole doctrine
of Wages was clearly and carefully laid down, and it is
only needful now to remind the reader of two or three of
those fundamental principles. The Labor-giver and the
Labor-taker only touch each other at the old points of reciprocal
Desires and Renderings. There are two persons
standing in that relation each to each. A rate of Wages is
always a result of a Comparison. If the Labor-takers,
whoever they may be, more strongly desire the services
of the Labor-givers, whoever they may be, other things
remaining as before, there will be a rise in the rates of
Wages, because Effects always follow the operation of
Causes in Economics, as in all other scientific spheres;
and if the Labor-takers, for any reason, desire less than
before the services of Laborers, other things being equal,
the general rates of Wages will decline of necessity.</p>

<p>Now, what is the necessary effect of Protectionism upon
the general Demand for Laborers? How is the whole
class of Labor-takers affected by prohibitory tariff-taxes?
Note every time, that it is the presently and independently
<i>profitable</i> industries, the industries that ask for nothing
except to be let alone, that are struck and restrained by
these tariff-taxes; the fact that any industry is successfully
going forward under its own motives is sufficient proof of
its own profitableness; these are the industries, in every
case, which are curtailed by restrictive tariff-taxes, their
former gains are lessened of course and by design, and
their <i>motives</i> consequently to hire Laborers to carry on
these branches of business now taxed and tormented are
<i>lessened</i>; less Desire for Labor-givers gives laborers less
every time round; the so-called argument of Protectionists
is, to introduce alleged <i>unprofitable</i> industries by means of
taxing down <i>profitable</i> ones; and pray, what effect must
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_521" id="Page_521">[521]</a></span>
that have upon the general Desire to employ Labor-givers,
and consequently what effect upon general rates of Wages?</p>

<p>Take one look further along this same line. Tariff-taxes
of this character are designed to keep out, and do
keep out, foreign wares, which are the natural and profitable
market for domestic wares: how will this forced
exclusion affect the Demand for laborers to make or grow
the domestic wares whose market is now lost? And what
is the influence on the Wages of those whose services are
now in lessened Desire along the whole line? Causes produce
their Effects everywhere and every time.</p>

<p>Dissatisfaction among, and actual disaster to, Labor-givers
as a class, have always followed the imposition of
protectionist tariff-taxes in this country, as a matter of
plain observation and record; have followed increasingly
and more disastrously increased restrictions and prohibitions
on profitable trade; "Strikes" on the one hand to
resist a lowering or secure a lifting of Wages, "Lockouts"
on the other to bring laborers to terms, "Shut-downs" for
pretended repairs in order to gain time to tide over the
gluts that always accompany artificially restricted markets,
semi-hostile relations between Employers and Employed,
interruptions to travel and transportation, timidities of
Capital fatal to new and enlarged enterprises, have never
characterized this country so strikingly as during the
quarter-century of Protectionism culminating in 1890.</p>

<p>The following table accurately compiled by Editor Philpott
of Iowa, from the National Census, shows in remarkable
figures the relatively slow rate of progress of the
Nation in thirteen essential items of growth under the
Morrill Tariff, as compared with the rapid rates of progress
in the leading lines under the Walker Tariff. <i>The comparison
lies in the per centum of increase over the previous
decade of the period 1850-60 relatively to each of the two</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_522" id="Page_522">[522]</a></span>
<i>periods 1860-70 and 1870-80: the average of the last two
periods is taken for the sake of an easier comparison of the
progress of the one decade (Walker) with the average of the
two later ones (Morrill).</i></p>

<p>The State of Massachusetts has been diligently and
scientifically taking the Statistics of everything relating
to Laborers as such for many years; and we take now by
way of confirmation of what has just been written a few
statements of fact from the official Reports. <i>One-third of
Massachusetts wage-earners were out of work one-third of the
time under the benign influence of Protectionism [1887].
Wages went down in Massachusetts on the whole average 5
per centum 1872-83, while in the same interval of time they
went up 9 per centum in Great Britain [1885]. Wages in
Massachusetts advanced in 1830-60 (Walker) 52 per centum
and in 1860-83 only 28 per centum (Morrill). What is
called the needful cost of living increased in Massachusetts
between 1860 and 1878 (Morrill) 14&#189; per centum in spite
of immense cheapenings in costs of production and transportation
[1885].</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_523" id="Page_523">[523]</a></span></p>

<p>The U. S. Government has been gathering for a long
time important Statistics relating to Laborers and their
Wages and their Costs of Living, not only in the decennial
Censuses but also in Consular Reports and in the Reports
of a national Commission established for that purpose.
We excerpt a few relevant statements from these almost
at random. <i>Wages in free-trade England are from 50 to 100
per centum higher than they are in any protectionized country
on the Continent of Europe. The aggregate Values of this
country increased 1850-60 (Walker) 126 per centum, and
in 1870-80 (Morrill) only 80 per centum, after reducing
the census values of 1870 to a gold basis. Vessels American-owned
and American-built controlled three-fourths of
our foreign carrying trade in 1856, and less than one-sixth
of it in 1886.</i></p>

employed in the great subdivisions of industry in the
United States as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>Our manufactures were put down in the Census of
1880 as in value $5,369,579,191. But this sum contains
$1,670,000,000 that does not strictly belong to manufactures,
such as flouring, lumbering, blacksmithing, sugar-refining,
coffee-roasting, slaughtering, and a few others.
This sum being taken out, there is left in round numbers but
$3,700,000,000. This is not a great amount for 50,000,000
of people, and for a land with such natural advantages
for manufacturing as our own.</p>

<p>Fallacy E: <i>that the costs of Wages to employers and of
Materials to manufacturers somehow justify Protectionism</i>.
The harmful confusion is constantly made here between
Rates of Wages and Costs of Labor&mdash;two very diverse
matters. Rates of Wages depend on a very different set
of circumstances from Costs of Labor. Failure to draw
this distinction, and a desperate desire to clutch even at a
straw with which to bolster up absurd Restrictions, have
made a hotch-potch and a caricature of attempted argument
at this point. Rates of Wages have always been
relatively high in this country as compared with the countries
of Europe for two general reasons: (1) the country
is new, with enormous natural advantages of every sort,
with comparatively few laborers competing steadily with
each other for work, large numbers of persons passing constantly
out of the employed into the employing classes;
and (2) there has almost always been from the first, and
there is likely to be again in the immediate future even if
there be not at the present moment, a Money in this country
depreciated below the gold standards of Europe, in
which the rates of current wages are always reckoned, and
which makes them <i>seem</i> to be higher than they actually are
in purchasing-power. On the other hand, Costs of Labor
have always been, and are now, low in this country
as compared with Europe, for two general reasons also:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_525" id="Page_525">[525]</a></span>
(1) all classes of laborers are more efficient and skilled in this
country than in Europe, working with more energy more
hours in the week, under less cost of superintendence,
being as a rule more temperate and healthful and educated
persons, so that employers <i>get more for what they give</i> than
do employers abroad; and (2) the cost of that to the employers
in which the laborers are paid, whether money or
other valuables, is always less here than abroad, because
the money usually is depreciated money which costs less
in commodities, and even if it be not, the current prices of
general commodities are higher here than there, so that the
cost of wages paid directly or indirectly in commodities is
less here to employers.</p>

<p>A second and distinct and wholly convincing proof, that
the Cost of Labor to employers has been less here than
abroad during the first century of our national existence,
has been the unquestioned fact, that the Rate of Profits
has been higher. A constant stream of foreign Capital has
come hither for investment, drawn solely by the higher
rates of Profit. But if the rates of Profit have proven to
be higher, the costs of Labor must have been lower, because
laborers and capitalists divide the whole returns between
them. Nobody else has any claim upon the conjoint proceeds.
<i>Profits are the Leavings of the Costs of Labor.</i> If,
therefore, these Leavings are larger in one country than
another, then of necessity the Costs of Labor are lower in
the first country.</p>

<p>Now, Protectionists have had the effrontery (largely the
result of ignorance) to contend, that they are at a disadvantage
as employers of laborers on account of the rates
of Wages they are obliged to pay to them! <i>Exactly the
reverse is the truth.</i> Instead of being at any disadvantage
at this point, it is a matter of absolute demonstration, that
American employers pay the smallest costs of Labor in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_526" id="Page_526">[526]</a></span>
world! Employers as such have no interest in the rates
of Wages as such, but only in the costs of Labor to themselves
as capitalists. High rates of Wages not only usually
accompany low costs of Labor, but also are a proof of them!
The patient (not to say stupid) American People have consented
for thirty years past to be abominably taxed for the
exclusive benefit of a set of brazen mendicants, on the
ostensible ground, that the said public beggars were unfortunately
placed in comparison with European competitors,
when the simple truth has been, that they had a constant
advantage in the best, and cheapest (in cost to themselves),
and steadiest and most intelligent (on the whole), laborers
in the world.</p>

<p>What is the truth about raw materials in this country?
Especially raw materials in those branches of industry,
which have been most steadily protectionized from the
first, like iron and copper, and cottons and woollens? Can
any reason be found for legislatively excluding foreign
products of these classes on the ground of any disadvantage
of our producers on the score of raw materials?
Look at iron ore, for example, now protectionized to the
extent of 75 cents per ton. No country in the world possesses
such deposits in quantity and quality and accessibility
of iron ore as the United States of America. Vast
beds of the best ore in the world, especially in wide
regions along the whole course of the Tennessee River,
lie directly upon the surface of the ground; and the so-called
"Iron Mountain" in Missouri is said to have ore
enough above the general surface of the country round to
supply the wants of the entire United States for two centuries!
Yet every ton of this ore is artificially lifted in
price to the very People to whom God gave it in exceeding
abundance. The average cost of mining, washing,
screening, and loading upon steam freight-cars for transportation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_527" id="Page_527">[527]</a></span>
to market, of brown-hematite ore at one of the
Mines in Tennessee during the summer and autumn of
1890, was 33 cents per ton, with a constant downward
tendency in cost as machinery was multiplied and methods
improved. This included the rent paid to the owners of
the land holding the ore-beds, and every other item of cost
carefully computed by the owner of the capital and manager
at the mines. This statement is made on the authority
of the said owner and manager over his own sign manual,
with his consent given that it be printed as at present in
the interest at once of Science and Righteousness.</p>

<p>It has often been publicly stated by experts, that there
is more coal in deposit in the United States than in all the
rest of the world put together. Nevertheless, bituminous
coal has been protectionized since 1874 to the extent of 75
cents per ton, and slack or culm (another form of coal)
40 and 30 cents per ton. The bounty of God to the people
of this country has been so far forth thwarted by the
greed of mine-owners acting on the subservience of members
of Congress to the few rich combined for that purpose
to the impoverishment of the unorganized masses. Especially
has every interest of New England both popular
and manufacturing been sacrificed to the short-sighted
selfishness of the mine-owners, because the British Provinces,
just to the northward, are full of bituminous coal
waiting for a market against New England goods.</p>

<p>Limestone is a second indispensable requisite for the
reduction of iron ores. God has put the ore and the coal
and the lime in unfailing quantities in close proximity
with each other throughout the entire valley of the Tennessee.
So small is the natural cost of making iron in that
favored region, that it has been transported this summer
to Savannah by rail (freights heightened by tariff-taxes on
steel rails and lumber), and then exported 3000 miles to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_528" id="Page_528">[528]</a></span>
Liverpool with good profits to the makers by their own
confession.</p>

<p>Steel rails are protectionized at present to the extent of
$17 per ton, formerly $28 per ton. Fortunately, we have
at present a competent National Labor-Commissioner, heretofore
in the service of Massachusetts in the same capacity,
Carroll D. Wright, who has just made a Report to Congress
on the comparative cost of producing steel rails here and
abroad. The following table is national and official and
indisputable. It shows the Element of Cost in one ton of
steel rails in Eleven distinct establishments, the first Two
being located in the United States, the next Seven in
countries on the Continent of Europe, and the last Two in
Great Britain. The first column gives the Cost of the
Material in the several districts, the second the Cost of
Labor, and the third the total cost of the rails.</p>

<p>The reader who knows how to read between the lines
will observe the strong confirmation of this table to the
point already made in these pages, namely, that the "pauper
labor of Europe" costs much more at a given point than
the more highly paid labor of England and the United
States. Thus: the average Cost of Labor in a ton of rails
in the two latter countries is $1.70; the average in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_529" id="Page_529">[529]</a></span>
seven Continental countries is $2.63. The average total
cost per ton in the nine foreign countries is $22.77; the
average in the two establishments here is $26.23. It must
be remembered, that the cost of the material and of all the
processes of manufacture here is greatly enhanced by the
device of the tariff-taxes: still the difference in cost is
even then only $3.46 per ton greater than the foreigners'
cost: considering that these foreign rails must be carried
3000 miles over sea, how comes it that a tariff-tax of $28
or $17 per ton is needful in order to foster rail-making in
this country? Take off all the tariff-taxes the rail-makers
and transporters have <i>to pay out</i>, and could they not well
forego the additional taxes they now impose on their
fellow-citizens? Is there anything anywhere in the natural
costs of Materials and Labor here to put American manufacturers
at any disadvantage in their natural lines of
business as compared with foreigners in <i>their</i> natural lines
of industry?</p>

<p>Fallacy F: <i>that artificial tariff-burdens placed at one
point may become a compensation for other such burdens
placed at another point of the same general line</i>. This fallacy
has been luridly illustrated in this country since 1867,
when in the Wool and Woollens Tariff of that year additional
protectionism was accorded to Woollens ostensibly
to compensate the manufacturers for protectionism then
first accorded to raw wools. For a number of years the
woollen manufacturers had succeeded in persuading the
wool-growers not to demand of Congress tariff-taxes on raw
wools, thus publicly confessing that such taxes raise the
prices of materials to the manufacturers thereof. But the
wool-raisers argued naturally, if protectionism be good for
woollens, it must also be good for wools; the truth was, it
was equally baneful to both, and to every other beneficiary
of it in the long run; but the wool-workers had no answer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_530" id="Page_530">[530]</a></span>
to the simple logic of the wool-growers,&mdash;they gave their
case away when they alleged that <i>they</i> could not live without
government aid,&mdash;and so they were obliged to surrender
to their already angered brethren of the fleeces in 1867,
and higher tariff-taxes were put on the woollens in order
to compensate the manufacturers for the anticipated rise in
the price of wools. Of course it was supposed that the
patient people would bear the now doubled burdens put
upon them by <i>two</i> privileged sets of their fellow-citizens.
If protectionist taxes made the manufacturers rich, why
should they not also enrich the rural herdsmen? In short,
why may not such taxes make everybody rich?</p>

<p>There were those at the time, and the present writer was
one of them, who foresaw and foretold just what has
actually happened, namely, that both allies in this scheme
of popular plunder were going in to their own death as
well as in to the impoverishment of their countrymen.
How would any level-headed man, capable of seeing beyond
the point of his nose, have prognosticated in the premises?
Something like this: it takes many kinds of wools mixed,
say six or eight, to make the best woollen cloths, and
several kinds to make good cloths at all; the United States
could only furnish two or three kinds, and these in quite
limited quantities; the tariff-taxes would raise the price of
the foreign wools by just so much, to the detriment of the
manufacturers, who could no longer buy the foreign wools,
needful for good cloths, and must consequently drop
down to inferior cloths in their mills, using shoddy and
cotton and what not: how will that affect the market for
native wools, especially the fine Ohio and Vermont wools?
Only as the manufacturers are prosperous in making good
cloths that find a quick and wide market at home, can the
growers find a good market for their wool; from these
heavy taxes on their material and machinery and lumber
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_531" id="Page_531">[531]</a></span>
and dye-stuffs and so on, the manufacture will surely
droop, and employ itself on poor goods from cheap materials,
and the market for native fleeces will droop in consequence,
and the prices of home-wools will go down and
down and down of necessity.</p>

<p>Precisely this has happened. The gold prices of wool
were never before so low in this country as since the
unholy alliance of 1867, and as a rule they have gone
down lower and lower and lower. Why? Because the
manufacturers <i>could</i> not, under the tax-laws of their
country which they themselves had egged on, make the
cloths demanding the native fine wools. Sheep-raising
became unprofitable. Millions of fine-woolled sheep were
slaughtered in a few years for their pelts and mutton in
Ohio alone. The following official table from the Department
of Agriculture exhibits the relative number of sheep
in thirteen States of the Union, at the two epochs 22 years
apart:&mdash;</p>

<p>The effect of the tariff-taxes on wools, accordingly, even
during a period when the population of the country increased
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_532" id="Page_532">[532]</a></span>
65 <i>per centum</i>, has been <i>to diminish the number of
sheep in the hands of the farmers by more than one-half</i>.
The wool clip in the entire country has indeed increased
since 1867, but it has been in Texas and on the free ranges
of the extreme boundaries of civilization in the West,
where about one pound in three of the gross fleece is clean
wool, and the most favorable estimate of the present clip
would only suffice to clothe about one-half of the people
of the country. Does this look like becoming "<i>independent</i>"
of the rest of the world in the matter of woollen
clothing for our great People? Will our folks never learn
that there is nothing "<i>dependent</i>" in Buying and Selling,
that the more any individual or nation Buys and Sells
the more <i>independent</i> they become of course, and that the
hermit in his poverty-stricken cell is the best image of
Protectionism?</p>

<p>The extra barriers heaped up in 1867 against foreign
woollens not only did not lessen their importation, but in
connection with the discouragements thrown upon the
domestic manufacture as just explained increased the importations;
so that, in 1877, imports of woollen goods stood
at $25,000,000; and in 1882 had increased to $42,000,000,
the latter being an increase in one year, from 1881, of 34
<i>per centum</i>. The people must be clothed at some rate, and
many people will have good cloth at any cost; and the
whole result of this imbecile policy of Prohibitions on wool
and woollens has been demonstrated right before our eyes,
(1) to kill off the sheep, (2) to compel the manufacture
of poor goods, (3) to multiply foreign woollens in domestic
use, and (4) to double in general the cost of clothing the
American People. It is difficult to say whether the
grangers as a class, or the manufacturers as a class, or
the consumers of woollens, are more put out by this state
of things. They are all in the slough together, and have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_533" id="Page_533">[533]</a></span>
only themselves to thank for their condition. And it is
growing worse and worse. As a mere and small example,
less than one-half the amount of woollen machinery is
now in operation in Berkshire County, Massachusetts, that
was running here 15 years ago; and three-fourths of all
the woollen manufacturers doing business in the County
have failed in the 20 years just now past. In one word, <i>it
is no compensation to one industry for artificial burdens piled
upon it, to pile corresponding burdens upon other industries
affiliated with it</i>. <span class="smcap">All legitimate industries everywhere
are intimately affiliated with each other.</span></p>

<p>Fallacy G: <i>that because some kinds of prosperity sometimes
accompany and follow after Protectionism, therefore
they are caused by it</i>. This is at once the commonest
and the hollowest of the forms of false argumentation
employed in this country to bolster up a monstrously
unjust Privilege. The rapid growth of Chicago, for example,
in the ten years following the first imposition of
the Morrill tariff-taxes, was often referred to, as if the
Taxes caused the Growth. Admitting for argument's
sake, what would be the height of folly to admit in reality,
that these Taxes were <i>among</i> the causes of that Growth,
how absurd to refer to one antecedent the result of one
hundred or one thousand antecedents! So of the growth
of national population in the twenty years following the
Wool and Woollens Tariff of 1867: population increased
about 65 <i>per centum</i> in that interval: tariff-taxes on most
of the necessaries of life increased in the same interval just
about in the same proportion: was there any tie of Cause
and Effect as between the rise of taxes and the rising tide
of population? Any <i>tendency</i> in the one to bring the
other? Because one thing <i>follows</i> another in point of
time, is that any proof that the second is the <i>result</i> of the
other in point of cause?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_534" id="Page_534">[534]</a></span></p>

<p>In the old classification of Logical Fallacies this particular
one was called by the Romans "<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">post hoc ergo propter
hoc</i>," that is, <i>after something therefore on account of that
thing</i>. The thoughts and the speech of civilized men have
always been full of some form of this incongruity of inference;
but it is the stock in trade, the staple and body of
protectionist argumentation. But it is utterly devoid
of any significance whatever. Unless some natural tie of
connection can be shown, as between precedent and consequent,
unless it can be probably shown that <i>nothing but</i>
the precedent could cause the consequent, unless taxes
are adapted in their very nature to increase riches, unless
repeated subtractions can be shown to be the same thing
as multiplied additions, then all this sickening talk of
cheapening prices and intensified activities and diffused
popular blessings under an odious scheme of subtle taxes
that only <i>take</i> and can never <i>give</i>, is to be treated with a
silent and pitying contempt, whether used by the duped
or the duping. A good instance of this empty form of
reasoning,&mdash;much better because more uniform than any
one ever sought to be applied in the realm of Trade,&mdash;would
be this: the Day has uniformly followed after the
Night ever since the dawn of Time, and therefore the
Night is the cause of the Day!</p>

<p>It has been indeed hard work to destroy the commerce
utterly of a great People by legal restraints however multiplied
and by mountain-barriers however piled up, and
some prosperity has pushed itself into prominence after all
these and in spite of all these. Behold! cry the logical
protectionists, behold in such prosperity the <i>effects</i> of our
beautiful legislation! Immeasurable areas of fertile land
to be had by all Immigrants for the asking; endless
deposits on every hand of coal and of all the useful and
precious metals; primeval forests and streams leaping
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_535" id="Page_535">[535]</a></span>
with power from their mountain springs to mill-wheel and
intervale; commodious land-locked ocean harbors on every
side but one, and vast chains of inland "unsalted seas";
a salubrious climate, and an ingenious, well-trained people;
self-organized and liberal governments, guaranteeing all
rational liberties to the people&mdash;but one; all these antecedents
and accompaniments go, as it were, for nothing in
the minds and on the tongues of some of our citizens, as
causes of accruing prosperity, in comparison with (as a
cause) the commercial bondage at the one point possible
under our liberal and blessed institutions.</p>

<p>These are seven of the fundamental Falsities of Protectionism.
They might easily be made seven times seven,
and even seventy times seven. But not one of them is to
be forgiven. They are unpardonable sins against Science
and Liberty and Progress. Any radical and comprehensive
Falsehood, like Protectionism, practically contradicts
the Truth at innumerable points. The test of any proposed
truth is its harmony with other and acknowledged
truths: the test of any suspected error is its contradiction
to such truths. Enough has now been said to settle the
place of any pretended right of a part of the people commercially
to enslave the other part, and ultimately themselves
also.</p>

<p>It only remains in this chapter, in the fourth place, to
indicate briefly at a few points the course of <span class="smcap">Opinions</span>
in relation to commercial Restrictions and Prohibitions in
general, such as exist at present in their most exaggerated
forms within the United States, on the part of those best
entitled by study and intellect and opportunity to form
and formulate a candid judgment in such matters.</p>

<p>In respect to the personal motive and circumstances of
those combining to frame such legal interferences with the
natural liberty of their contemporaries, and the inevitable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_536" id="Page_536">[536]</a></span>
results of them, we will quote first from Sir Thomas More,
a man of men, in his Utopia, written in 1516. "<i>The rich
are ever striving to pare away something further from the
daily wages of the poor by private fraud, and even by public
laws; so that the wrong already existing, for it is a wrong
that those from whom the State derives most benefit should
receive least reward, is made yet greater by means of the law
of the State. It is nothing but a conspiracy of the rich
against the poor. The rich devise every means by which they
may in the first place secure to themselves what they have
amassed by wrong, and then take to their own use and profit
at the lowest possible price the work and labor of the poor.
And so soon as the rich decide on adopting these devices in
the name of the public, then they become law. The life of
the labor-class becomes so wretched in consequence that even a
beast's life seems enviable.</i>"</p>

<p>The utter folly of supposing that a Parliament or a
Congress or a Committee of either is fit to determine, or to
have any voice in deciding, what shall or what shall not be
manufactured or grown, what shall or what shall not be
exported and imported, was never more happily exposed
than by Adam Smith in his Wealth of Nations, published
in 1776. "<i>The statesman who should attempt to
direct private people in what manner they ought to employ
their capitals, would not only load himself with a most
unnecessary attention, but would assume an authority which
could be safely trusted not only to no single person, but to no
council or senate whatever, and which would nowhere be so
dangerous as in the hands of a man who had folly and presumption
enough to fancy himself fit to exercise it.</i>"</p>

<p>Alexander Hamilton, our first Secretary of the Treasury,
and in some respects the most brilliant of all our statesmen,
has often been claimed and referred to as a protectionist by
those unfamiliar with his writings; but the paragraph of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_537" id="Page_537">[537]</a></span>
those writings, or the phrase of any authenticated conversation
of his, has never been quoted and never can be,
because they do not exist, which proves him to have been
a "protectionist" in the modern, or any other proper,
sense of that word. On the contrary, his deliberate and
well-founded opinion in the premises is given at length
in number XXXV of the Federalist, this number printed
early in 1788: "<i>Exorbitant duties on imported articles serve
to beget a general spirit of smuggling; which is always prejudicial
to the fair trader, and eventually to the revenue itself:
they tend to render other classes of the community tributary,
in an improper degree, to the manufacturing classes,
to whom they give a premature monopoly of the markets:
they sometimes force industry out of its most natural channels
into which it flows with less advantage; and in the last place,
they oppress the merchant, who is often obliged to pay them
himself without any retribution from the consumer. When
the Demand is equal to the quantity of goods at market, the
consumer generally pays the duty; but when the markets
happen to be overstocked, the great proportion falls upon the
merchant, and sometimes not only exhausts his profits, but
breaks in upon his capital. I am apt to think, that a division
of the duty between the seller and the buyer more often happens
than is commonly imagined. There is no part of the
administration of the Government that requires extensive
information, and a thorough knowledge of the principles of
Political Economy, so much as the business of taxation. The
man who understands those principles best, will be least likely
to resort to oppressive expedients, or to sacrifice any particular
class of citizens to the procurement of revenue. It might
be demonstrated that the most productive system of finance
will always be the least burdensome.</i>"<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_538" id="Page_538">[538]</a></span></p>
<p>Shrewd old Benjamin Franklin, impersonation of common
sense and common honesty, ridicules in his sly way
the whole wretched business in the columns of the "Pennsylvania
Gazette" in 1789. "<i>I am a manufacturer, and
was a petitioner for the act to encourage and protect the
manufacturers of Pennsylvania. I was very happy when
the act was obtained, and I immediately added to the price
of my manufacture as much as it would bear, so as to be a
little cheaper than the same article imported and paying the
duty. By this addition I hoped to grow richer. But as
every other manufacturer, whose wares are under the protection
of the act, has done the same, I begin to doubt whether,
considering the whole year's expenses of my family, with all
these separate additions which I pay to other manufacturers,
I am at all the gainer. And I confess, I cannot but wish
that, except the protecting duty on my own manufacture, all
duties of the kind were taken off and abolished.</i>"</p>

<p>In the first congressional debate on the Tariff after the
new Government went into operation, that is, in 1789,
Fisher Ames of Massachusetts, who had just before made
the strongest plea against the Molasses Tax, the raw material
of New England rum, became also the strongest
stickler there for the protectionist view, that artificial
manufactures may properly enough fasten and fatten
upon Agriculture, like shell-fish upon ship-bottoms, and
went to the root of the whole matter of that inevitable
antagonism in a few frank and radical words, the best
because the most truthful words that can be found upon
that side in the century that has followed. "<i>From the
different situation of the manufacturers in Europe and
America, encouragement is necessary. In Europe, the artisan
is driven to labor for his bread. Stern necessity, with</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_539" id="Page_539">[539]</a></span>
<i>her iron rod, compels his exertion. In America, invitation
and encouragement are needed. Without them, the infant
manufacture droops, and those who might be employed in
it seek with success a competency from our cheap and fertile
soil.</i>"</p>

<p>Gouverneur Morris, one of the youngest and among the
most gifted of the Revolutionary statesmen, had a clear
insight into Economic realities. "<i>Whatever saves Labor
rewards Labor.</i>" "<i>Those who will give the most for money,
in other words, those who will sell cheapest, will have the
most money.</i>" "<i>Taxes can be raised only from revenue:
push the matter further, and their nature is changed: it is
no longer taxation, it is confiscation.</i>"</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII.<br />

<small>TAXATION.</small></h2>


<p>Political Economy is the Science of Buying and Selling.
It must include of course in its discussions the
Motives, the Methods, the Obstacles, the Rewards, relating
to Sales, which are themselves first to be defined as furnishing
the sole Field of the Science. We have now gone
through with painstaking all of these topics in order, but
we have not yet fairly struck Taxation, which is indeed in
all its forms an obstacle to Sales, and in some of them the
annihilation of Sales, but which in its nature is something
much more than an obstacle, namely, a Condition of something
higher than itself. In the very strictest sense of the
terms, Taxation is not a part of the Science of Political
Economy, because it is not an essential part of any one of
those natural processes by which men buy and sell and get
gain. It is rather a Condition through Government of the
successful ongoing of all those processes. There cannot
be, therefore, a <i>science</i> of Taxes, as there is unquestionably
a science of Sales. The facts of Taxes are artificial and
governmental, the facts of Sales are natural and original.</p>

<p>All forms of Production, as we have now seen, go
forward in accordance with positive natural forces and
motives, which God has appointed, and which men have
a natural impulse to ascertain and generalize and profit
by; for it is Nature bids men work and save, buy and
sell, invent and transport, navigate and grow rich; but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_541" id="Page_541">[541]</a></span>
Nature has given no whisper anywhere, at least that we
can hear, about any Taxes. That is the work of Society.
That seems to be something negative, not positive, so far
as Buying and Selling is concerned. Taxation is indeed
something necessary to the social order, as men are; it
furnishes means of defence against greater evils than itself
is; but in itself considered, it is an economic evil, because
it takes away from exchangers a part of the gains of their
exchanges; strictly speaking, therefore, it cannot be made
a part of Economic Science.</p>

<p>But, on the other hand, as we shall see at length in the
exposition that follows, all the relations of Taxation from
the beginning to the end are so ultimately connected with
Exchanges, are so founded on and limited by Exchanges,
its true principles are so exclusively economical, and its
abuses are so instantly and constantly harmful to all the
ongoings of natural and profitable Trade, that Taxation
must always be treated as if it were a part of Economics.
The latter is a science, the former is an art; but the art is
almost exclusively dependent upon the principles of this
one science; and a comprehensive treatise on the science,
accordingly, must exhibit all its main bearings upon those
practical rules of Taxation, which are so vital to the happiness
and prosperity of any People. All scientific Economists,
therefore, have considered the subject of Taxes to
lie within their legitimate beat. They have, however,
justified the inclusion upon very different grounds, one
from another; and so far as now appears, the present writer
was the first technical Economist to disclaim in the name
of his Science direct jurisdiction over Taxation.</p>

<p>A careful discussion of a series of distinct though related
Questions belonging to Taxes will exhibit the whole practical
matter in the light of well-established principles of
economical Science.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_542" id="Page_542">[542]</a></span></p>

<p>1. What is the fundamental <span class="smcap">Ground</span> of Taxes? <i>Government</i>
is an essential prerequisite to any general and satisfactory
Exchanges, since it contributes by direct effort
to the security of person and property; and justly claims,
therefore, from each citizen a compensation in return for
the Services thus rendered to him. We do not mean to
say that government exists solely for the protection of
person and property, or that all the operations of government
are to be brought down within the sphere of exchange,
for government exists as well for the improvement as for
the protection of society, and many of its high functions
are moral, to be performed under a lofty sense of responsibility
to God and to future ages; nor do we mean to say
that government has not also a deep ground for its existence,
in virtue of which it may on extraordinary occasions
demand all the property of all, and even the lives of some,
of its citizens; but we do mean to say that, whatever may
be conceded as the ultimate ground of government, the
matter of taxation, by which government is outwardly and
ordinarily supported, and by which it takes to itself a part
of the gains of every man's industry, finds a ready and
solid justification in the common principles of Exchange.
If, as far as the tax-payer is concerned, the exchange does
not seem to be voluntary, on a closer analysis it is seen to
be really voluntary; for in effect the people organize government
for themselves, and voluntarily support it, and
there is no government separate from the will of the people.</p>

<p>In a very important sense, accordingly, a tax paid is a
reward for a service rendered. The service which government
renders to Production by its laws, courts, and officers,
by the force which it is at all times ready to exert in behalf
of any citizen or the whole society when threatened with
evil in person or property, is rendered somewhat on the
principle of division of labor, one set of agents devoting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_543" id="Page_543">[543]</a></span>
themselves to that work; and, notwithstanding some crying
abuses of authority which no constitution or public
virtue has yet been found adequate wholly to avert, is rendered
on the whole economically and satisfactorily. Taxes,
therefore, demanded of citizens by a lawful government
which tolerably performs its functions, are legitimate and
just on principles of Exchange alone.</p>

<p>2. What is the <span class="smcap">Source</span> out of which Taxes are actually
paid? The answer is, out of the gains of Exchanges of
some sort. Gifts aside, and thefts which are out of the
question, no man ever did, no man ever can, pay his taxes,
except out of the gains of some sales which he has already
made. Even the man who lives wholly on the interest of
his money must make a true exchange in lending it (a
credit transaction), and must already have gotten his
return-service in interest, before he can pay his taxes; personal
and professional servants must receive their wages,
the outcome of exchanges, before they can possibly pay
their taxes; and men can realize nothing for taxes or other
payments from their farms or foundries or stocks in trade
except as they sell either them or their products. The
more sales, the more gains, and the greater reservoir
whence taxes may be drawn. Political Economy, as the
vindicator of sales, as the defender of all legitimate gains
whatsoever, is the best possible friend of tax-payers and
tax-gatherers as such. Whatever thought or force restricts
sales, makes it <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pro tanto</i> the harder to pay and collect
taxes, so much the harder for a government to keep its
head above water and reach the ends of its being.</p>

<p>It follows from all this, by a necessary inference, that
the annual Taxes of any country must come out of the
annual Earnings of the people of that country, using the
word "earnings" in its general and proper sense. The
greater the earnings <i>per capita</i>, the easier are the taxes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_544" id="Page_544">[544]</a></span>
paid. Sir Richard Temple read an address not long since
in the Section of Economic Science and Statistics of the
British Association, some of whose results are not only
interesting but also astonishing. For instance, taking the
whole population of the United Kingdom (England, Scotland,
and Ireland), without division into classes, he demonstrates
that the average of yearly earnings per head of the
population is £35 4<i>s.</i>, or $171.28. This exceeds the average
earnings in the United States by 30%, £27 4<i>s.</i>:£35 4<i>s.</i>
It exceeds also the average on the Continent of Europe by
95%, £18 1<i>s.</i>:£35 4<i>s.</i> It falls below that of Australia
only, £43 4<i>s.</i>:£35 4<i>s.</i>, or 19% less. Canada's average
earnings <i>per capita</i> are $126.80, or 5% less than those in
the United States, £27 4<i>s.</i>:£26 18<i>s.</i> According to the
same unimpeachable authority in the same paper, the
annual income from investments is in Great Britain and
the United States as nearly as possible one-seventh of the
aggregate Property in each (all kinds), or 14%. In
Canada and Australia, 18% and 22% respectively. Undoubtedly
the most profitable country in the world at
present is Australia, and Great Britain stands next. The
only apparent reason why the United States, whose natural
resources of every kind are vastly superior to either,
takes the third rank is, that profitable exchanges here are
forcefully suppressed by law, and that to an enormous
extent, neutralizing natural resources and glorious opportunities
for easily acquired and widespread gains. This
violent suppression of commerce by national legislation
makes it just so much the harder for any man to pay his
taxes, whether these be due to Nation, State, or Municipality.
If the reservoir be diminished the flow from it
through every pipe becomes feebler.</p>

<p>3. In what <span class="smcap">Proportion</span> ought the individual citizens to
contribute to the fund annually necessary to be raised by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_545" id="Page_545">[545]</a></span>
Taxation? The usual answer has been, that a man should
be taxed according to his <i>Property</i>. That is the radically
correct answer, though most who have given it have not
understood clearly the meaning of the word <i>property</i>. We
have already seen that the ultimate idea of property is the
power and right to render services in exchange, and defined
it as <i>anything that can be bought and sold</i>. Robinson
Crusoe, while solitary upon his island, did not and could
not have property, in the true sense of that word. It is
not the fact of appropriation that makes anything property;
it is not the fact that a man has made it or transformed it,
that makes anything property; it is not the fact that a
man may rightfully give it away, that makes anything
property; but it is the fact that a man has something, no
matter what it is, for which something else may be obtained
in exchange, that makes that something property, and gives
government the right to tax it. In other words, property
consists in Values, in a purchasing-power, and not in possession,
or in appropriation, or in the esteem in which a
man holds anything he has as long as it is his own.</p>

<p>The test of property is a sale; that which will bring
something when exposed for exchange is property; that
which will bring nothing, either never was, or has now
ceased to be, distinctively property. This view may not
seem to be as novel as it is, or it may be prejudiced by its
very novelty, but at any rate it carries along with it that
strongest of the criteria of truth, that it simplifies and illumines
a confused section of the field of human thinking;
and at the same time justifies a practice which governments
have reached, as it were through instinct, the practice,
namely, of taxing men who have neither real estate nor
chattels, on their incomes from industry and from credits.</p>

<p>To the general question, then, in what proportions shall
the citizens contribute in taxes to the support of government,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_546" id="Page_546">[546]</a></span>
the general answer comes, that they ought to
contribute <i>in proportion to the gains of their exchanges</i>, of
whatever kind they may be. The farm, the foundry, the
mill, the railroad, the real estate of every name; personal
property of every kind; and personal acquirements and
efforts of all descriptions, best appear, for the purposes of
taxation, <i>through the gains realized by means of them</i>. If,
for any reason, any of these become unproductive, taxes
should cease to be derived from them; indeed, must cease
to be derived from them, because their owners can no
longer pay by virtue of them. It may be objected that
lands, for example, presently unproductive, may be held
untaxed under this principle, held for the sake of a prospective
rise of price. Very well; when they are sold at a
profit, let the owner be taxed on that profit: it will be time
enough then, especially as men do not like to hold unproductive
forms of property. It may also be objected, that,
under this principle, wages, the result of personal and
professional exertion, would be taxed just the same as
profits and rents, the result of previously accumulated
property. Very well; they ought to be so taxed. Can
anybody give a solid reason why they ought not to be so
taxed? One may say, that a professional man earning a
large income, on which taxes are paid the same as on a similar
income of a land proprietor, dying, leaves to his children
no further means of earning, while the land-proprietor,
dying, does leave such means. Granted; but the land income
continues to pay taxes, while that professional income
does not! Other members of the profession will do the
business which the former one would have done had he
lived, and they will pay taxes on the income from it.
What a man transmits to his children, whether a great
name or a great estate, has nothing to do with the amount
of taxes that he ought to pay while he lives.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_547" id="Page_547">[547]</a></span></p>

<p>There is an illusion about lands and real property
that needs to be dissipated before men will understand
clearly the whole matter of Taxation. Without constant
watchfulness and foresight, without constant efforts in
improvements and repairs, almost every form of realized
property will rapidly deteriorate and become unproductive.
Land even in Great Britain, where land is scarce, is only
worth about twenty-five years' rent; and without the
exercise of intelligence and will property ceases to be.
<i>Property has its birth in services exchanged; services exchanged
give rise to gains; taxes can only be paid out of
these gains; they ought to be proportioned to the amount of
these gains without any reference to the class of exchanges
producing them; while the right to tax on the part of the
government is connected with a service rendered by government,
and both grows out of and is limited by the right to
exchange on the part of the citizens.</i> These considerations,
though they may exclude the propriety of a poll-tax, are
consistent with most other forms of taxation, and give
unity to them.</p>

<p>4. Does it not follow from all the preceding, that a single
and universal <span class="smcap">Income-Tax</span> would prove the best form of
what is in its own nature a subtraction from the gains
of the governed for the maintenance of Government? If
the approximate amount of Income could in all cases be
ascertained, and if no other form of tax were levied upon
the same persons, this would seem to be a perfectly unexceptionable
mode of Taxation. The only sources of Income
are three: Wages, Profits, Rents. It does not seem that
gifts are legitimately taxable; they lie outside the field
of exchange; they spring from sympathy, from benevolence,
from duty; and while exchange must claim all that
fairly belongs to it, it must be careful not to throw discouragements
into the adjacent but distinct fields of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_548" id="Page_548">[548]</a></span>
morals. Hence, it may well be questioned whether legacies,
bequeathments, gifts to charitable and educational institutions,
and gifts to individuals proceeding from friendship,
gratitude, or other such impulse, are properly subject to
taxation. The property is taxable in the hands of the
donor, and may be in the hands of the recipient, but the
passage from one to the other ought to be unobstructed by
a tax. Gifts, then, excepted, and plunder, which is out of
the question, the sources of income are few and simple,
and there is no great difficulty in every man ascertaining
about what his annual income is. Because this income,
exactly ascertained, exactly measures the gains of his
exchanges for that year, a tax upon that income is the
fairest of all possible forms of taxation, and might be made
with advantage, in time, to supersede all other forms.</p>

<p>Superficial objections may be easily raised, and are
raised constantly in the United States, against any form
of an income-tax. Reference is often had to our national
experience with such a tax during and just after the late
Civil War. The truth is, that tax was thrown on in addition
to, and in no proper relations with, a large number
of other national taxes of all sorts, good and bad; it was
no possible experiment in Taxation, because there was no
opportunity of watching its operation separate from that
of other and confused forms; industry of all kinds was
demoralized by the war, and still more by a depreciated
and abominable paper money made legal tender for all
debts; and the tax became unpopular in influential quarters
for certain reasons not inherent in the nature of the
tax, and was discontinued in consequence. In order to be
fairly tested, an income-tax should either be exclusive, all
other taxes being intermitted for the time being; or at
least levied simply in itself in connection with a few other
simple taxes, each of which can be watched in its incidence
and results separately from the others.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_549" id="Page_549">[549]</a></span></p>

<p>Great Britain derives its national revenues almost wholly
from five sources; namely, (1) Excises, say £27,000,000
annually; (2) Customs, say £20,000,000; (3) Incomes, say
£12,000,000; (4) Stamps, say £12,000,000; (5) Postals, say
£9,000,000. The remaining, say £10,000,000, come from
miscellaneous sources. One feature of the English Income-tax
is, that it is varied from time to time according to prevailing
national needs, the rate having been lifted from 2<i>d.</i>
to 16<i>d.</i> per pound of income, according to estimated expenditures.
In 1857, it realized in our money $80,255,000. In
1866, the largest year, our own national income-tax realized
$60,894,135. By varying the rate to the pound of income
according to the prospective wants of the Exchequer, the
English have found for about forty years their income-tax
to be the most uniform, unfailing, expansive, and responsive
to control, of all their fiscal expedients.</p>

<p>The Prussians, too, are applying an income-tax as a
means of raising revenue with good success. There, as
in England it is somewhat complicated with other kinds
of taxes, and cannot exhibit itself altogether in its own
nature as if it were <i>exclusive</i>, such as all scientific economists
would like to see it tried somewhere on a large scale;
and the Germans have a different method from the English,
of making the tax more or less flexible as circumstances
vary. The English change the <i>rate</i> of the tax to the unit
of income: the Germans <i>graduate</i> the tax to different
classes of income-receivers. For example, those persons
having an income between 420 and 660 <i>marks</i> a year pay
84 pennies (<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">pfennige</i>) as income-tax; persons in the next
higher class pay 164 pennies a year; those in the class,
whose maximum income is 6000 marks, pay 44 marks and
80 pennies a year; and all persons whose income does
not rise above 420 marks are not subject to this tax. On
account of hard times a few years ago, Bismarck brought
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_550" id="Page_550">[550]</a></span>
it about, that all the classes included between 420 and 6000
marks of income should be wholly exempted from one-quarter's
taxes. A <i>mark</i> is 23.82 of our cents; and a
<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">pfennig</i> is one-hundredth of a mark.</p>

<p>Besides the complete harmony of an Income-tax with
the general principles of Taxation, as already unfolded,
it has several specific advantages over other forms of
Taxes.</p>

<p>a. It has no tendency <i>to disturb prices</i>. Were there no
taxation except on Incomes, and were all the incomes
rightly ascertained, the prices of everything would be just
as if there were no taxes at all. Taxation would then be
like the atmosphere, pressing equally on all points and
consciously on none. It is through tricks wrought on
Prices, that the greatest and most widely spread injustices
have been done and suffered in this country during the
past thirty years: a depreciated Money, whether of paper
or silver, raises some prices and not others, and some prices
before others, and thus distributes its mischiefs unequally;
protectionist tariff-taxes play of design fantastic tricks
with prices, raising some and depressing others, thus
working monstrous injustice on a vast scale; and almost
all forms of taxation become unequal and unjust through
their diverse action on Prices. But a universal Income-tax
exclusive of all others, properly levied and fully
responded to by the payers, would have no influence at
all upon prices, could by no possibility work essential
injustice, and would be certain to be very productive
without becoming burdensome.</p>

<p>b. A second great advantage of such an Income-tax in
such a country as this, would manifestly be, that all men
would be obliged to keep exact pecuniary accounts; more
orderly methods of Business would generally prevail;
most men would know much better than they do now
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_551" id="Page_551">[551]</a></span>
how they stand themselves, and whom of others to safely
trust; sudden commercial failures, indeed failures at all,
would be less frequent and severe; and everything in the
business world would be more aboveboard and better
known.</p>

<p>c. A third advantage of such an Income-tax, and the
chief, would be its tendencies <i>to fiscal simplicity</i>. Complexities
in the Exchequer are always and in many ways
expensive to the People. In this country, where distinct
taxes have to be paid, first to the local municipality, then
to the State, and last to the Nation, Income-taxes, were all
others abolished, would have this striking advantage, that
the local municipality might best ascertain the incomes of
all its legal residents once for all, no matter from what
sources local or other the incomes be derived; and, having
collected its own local <i>per centum</i>, the State and then the
Nation would each have to collect an additional <i>per centum</i>
on the same income for themselves. Or, better still, by
an amicable arrangement, neither party yielding up its
inherent right to tax, one set of officials might ascertain
the incomes and also collect the tax for all three governments
once for all. It may be long, it doubtless will be,
before we shall ever come to such economy and simplicity
and fiscal beauty as this is; for the pride of sovereignty is
very strong both in State and Nation; each is jealous of
the powers of the other, each is fond of the pelf and
patronage and officialism connected with the gathering of
the taxes, and each would be disinclined to yield anything
to the other; but the fact remains, that, as it is of acknowledged
moment to have the single Cæsar's image and inscription
on every piece of the national Money, so it is of
almost equal moment in point of cheapness and clearness
and simplicity to have the hand of Cæsar seen but once in
taking in the Taxes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_552" id="Page_552">[552]</a></span></p>

<p>Objection has been often raised to any form of Income-tax
from the publicity of private affairs resulting from it.
It was just this that proved fatal to our own first experiment
along this line of national action. But there seems
to be some confusion of ideas in connection with this
phrase, "publicity of private affairs," for really, so far as
taxation is concerned, there ought to be nothing "private"
about the amount of any man's income, or the aggregate
of all forms of his property, inasmuch as every man has a
<i>right</i> to know, that all his neighbors are contributing <i>pro
rata</i> with himself to support that Government, which is
<i>common</i> to him and them. There is nothing, at least there
should be nothing, "private" in connection with Government;
that is the one absolutely "<i>public</i>" thing of the
world; least of all should there be anything private in the
matter of public taxes, since in bearing up the burdens of
Government all the citizens are alike copartners, and in
this view and for this purpose each has a right to demand
a look into the books of all the others.</p>

<p>Another objection has often been raised, namely, that
some men will never give in a true return of their Income.
Ah! but they can be made to do so, as the forms are perfected,
as fraudulent returns are promptly punished by
additional assessment and collection, and as the memory
and conscience of the payers are quickened by the action
of a healthful public opinion brought to bear through the
annual publication of the list of their returns. Men are
not so isolated from each other as that a man's neighbors
do not know pretty well the general amount of his income.
There is the additional security of an oath, of the fear of
punishment, and of the wish to stand well with one's class.
At the worst, it may be said, that evasions and fraud accompany
also all other forms of Taxation.</p>

<p>5. What is the difference between <span class="smcap">Direct</span> and <span class="smcap">Indirect</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_553" id="Page_553">[553]</a></span>
Taxes? This is an old and proper division: we must now
see what is the economical basis of it. A direct tax is
levied on the very persons who are expected themselves to
pay it; an indirect tax is demanded from one person in
the expectation that he will pay it provisionally, but will
indemnify himself in the higher price which he will receive
from the ultimate consumer. Thus an income tax is direct,
while duties laid on imported goods are indirect. There
has been a great amount of discussion on the point whether
direct or indirect taxation be the more eligible form; but
the reader of penetration will perceive that there is not at
bottom any very radical difference between them; each is
alike a tax on actual or possible exchanges, with this main
difference, that men pay indirect taxes as a part of the
price of the goods they buy, without thinking perhaps that
it is a tax they are paying, and consequently without any
of the repugnance that is sometimes felt towards a tax-gatherer
who comes with an unwelcome demand. Thus
indirect taxes are conveniently and economically collected.
Especially is this true of impost taxes; since one set of
custom-house officers may collect easily and at once the
government tax which is ultimately paid by consumers all
over the country. The taxes also levied by the present
United States internal revenue law are indirect taxes,
whereby the government gets in a lump what is afterwards
distributed over many subordinate exchanges. The countervailing
disadvantage of indirect taxation, however, is, that
the price of the commodity is usually enhanced to an extent
much beyond the amount of the tax, partly because it is
a cover under which dealers may put an unreasonable demand,
and partly because the tax, having to be advanced
over and over again by the intermediate dealers, profits
rapidly accumulate as an element of the ultimate price.</p>

<p>Direct taxes are laid either on Income or Expenditure.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_554" id="Page_554">[554]</a></span>
As the difficulty of a tax on a person's whole expenditure
is much greater than one on his whole income, inasmuch as
the items are more numerous and more diffused, it is only
attempted to levy a few taxes on some special items of
expenditure, such as those on horses, carriages, plate,
watches, and so on; but as these do not reach all persons
with any degree of quality, they are so far forth objectionable.
A house-tax, levied on the occupier, and not on the
owner, unless he be at the same time the occupier, would
be a direct tax on expenditure every way unobjectionable.
Taking society at large, the house a man lives in and its
furniture are probably the most accurate index attainable
of the size of his general expenditures. They are open to
observation and current remark; they are that on which
persons rely more perhaps than on anything else external
for their consideration and station in life; the tax could be
assessed with very little trouble on the part of the assessor;
and it is well worthy the attention of our State and
National Legislatures, whether such a tax, if more taxes
should be needed, would not be more equal and more easy
of collection than any others now open; or whether it
might not with advantage take the place of some of the
complicated and objectionable taxes now laid. Direct
taxes have this general advantage over indirect, that they
bring the people into more immediate contact with the
government that lays the taxes, and subject it to a quicker
supervision and more effectual curb, whenever its expenditures
grow larger than the people think it desirable to incur;
perhaps they have this general disadvantage over indirect
taxes, especially over imposts, that the number of officials
required to assess and collect them is larger, thus swallowing
up a part of the proceeds of the taxes, with this liability
also of bringing the people into an attitude of hostility
to the government and to its contemplated expenditures.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_555" id="Page_555">[555]</a></span>
But whether the taxes be direct or indirect, or whatever be
their form, except it be a poll-tax, which is questionable at
best, they are laid upon Exchanges, and are designed to
withdraw for the use of the government a part of the Gains
of exchanges.</p>

<p>6. Are <span class="smcap">Credits</span> a legitimate subject of Taxation? The
answer is very easy. Unless this whole treatise from beginning
to end be unsound, Credits stand upon the same economical
grounds as Commodities and Services, and so may
be taxed for the same reasons as those may be taxed.
Whatever is bought and sold is properly enough taxed, if
the needs of the government require it, and if such taxation
would be productive and not too unequal. As Values
always spring from the action of individuals, so the incidence
of taxes is upon persons rather than upon things;
and the question is what can a man sell, or what has he
already sold, on the gains of which sale the government
may lay some claim? If I have a note and mortgage on
my neighbor's farm, I can sell it at any time to a third
party; it pays me interest <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad interim</i>, and I can collect it
at maturity. Government therefore properly taxes me for
that credit in my possession. It is a part of my property.
The holders of the government bonds occupy an economical
position exactly similar. They have a lien on the
national property and income. The credits they hold are
vendible commodities. They are a paper bearing interest.
They can be collected at maturity. They are indeed exempted
by law from municipal and State taxation. That
was a legitimate inducement held out to everybody alike to
invest in the bonds. But there is no reason why the nation,
having withdrawn them from town and State taxation,
should not itself all the more subject them to their fair
share of the national burdens, unless indeed it be claimed,
as perhaps it fairly may be, that the exemption enables the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_556" id="Page_556">[556]</a></span>
government to borrow at a just so much lower rate of interest.
The income at any rate derived from the bonds
should be taxed as soon as any other income is. It is no
longer any ground of merit, even if it ever has been, for
persons to buy the government debt. It is a mercantile
transaction, and should be so considered in relation to
taxes. So of other mercantile credits. They are taxable.
Massachusetts has had a great deal of trouble of late years
both in the Legislature and otherwise about the taxation
of mortgages on taxed Massachusetts farms and other real
estate. The question is intricate and full of difficulty.
Some things about it, however, are clear. The note and
mortgage is a different <i>piece</i> of property, and a different
<i>kind</i> of property, from the real estate. It is a peculiar sort
of credit. The owner of it is a different person from the
owner of the real estate. Either bit of property may change
hands without changing the <i>status</i> of the other. The
question of taxing the note and mortgage, like the question
of taxing the bonds, seems to hinge on the effect it would
have on the rate of interest of the obligation secured by
the mortgage. If the holder of the mortgage expects to
have to pay a tax upon it, he will try to get a higher rate
of interest on his money loaned and thus secured. Whether
mortgagees taxed as such <i>can</i> throw off the tax upon the
mortgagors in a higher rate of interest on the money loaned
is a point much disputed and at least doubtful. General
principles would lead us to favor the taxation of note and
mortgages in the hands of their holders, so long as such
cumbersome forms of taxing as prevail in Massachusetts
are maintained. A universal income-tax would solve this
difficulty also in a moment of time.</p>

<p>7. Has Political Economy anything to say about the
<span class="smcap">Rate</span> of taxes per unit of that which is subject to tax?
Yes; it has an important word to say upon that point.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_557" id="Page_557">[557]</a></span>
From the very nature of Taxes in general, and in order
that they may be most productive in the long run, as well
as discourage as little as possible the Exchanges which
would otherwise go forward, the Rate of taxes ought always
to be <i>low</i> relatively to the amount of Values exchangeable.
A high rate of tax not infrequently stops exchanges in the
taxed articles altogether, and of course the tax then realizes
nothing to the government. As the only motive to an
exchange is the gain of it, the exchange ceases whenever
the government cuts so deeply into the gain as to leave
little margin to the exchangers. The greater the gain
left to the parties, after the tax is abstracted, the more
numerous will the exchanges become, and the greater the
number of times will the tax fall into the coffers of the
government. In almost all articles, consumption increases
from a lowered price in even a greater ratio than the diminution
of the rate of tax; so that the interests of consumers
and of the revenue are not antagonistic but harmonious.
On articles of luxury and ostentation, and on those, such
as liquors and tobaccos, whose moral effects are clearly
questionable, very high taxes may properly enough be laid,
because their incidence will hardly tend to diminish consumption,
and it would scarcely be regretted if it did;
but with this exception, duties and taxes should be levied
at a low rate <i>per centum</i> as well for the interest of revenue
as of consumers. It is to be added, however, that the
taxes even on these articles may be too high to meet either
a revenue or a moral purpose. The internal tax of two
dollars a gallon upon distilled spirits was of this character.
Experience has demonstrated that a less tax will produce
more revenue, and the drinking of whiskey, bad as that is,
is less culpable than the endless frauds on the government
provoked by the high tax.</p>

<p>8. What is the difference between <span class="smcap">Specific</span> and <span class="smcap">Advalorem</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_558" id="Page_558">[558]</a></span>
Taxes, and why should the student take careful note
of these both singly and combined? These terms are used
more particularly in relation to Tariff-taxes, but there is
nothing in the distinction itself so to limit its application.
A Specific tax is a tax of so many cents or dollars on the
pound, yard, gallon, or other <i>quantity</i> measurable: an Advalorem
tax is a tax of so much <i>per centum</i> on the invoiced
or appraised <i>money value</i> of the goods subject to the tax.
Specific taxes, accordingly, are far simpler and steadier in
their operation than the others; it is easy to ascertain the
weight or number or other quantity of valuables, and then
to apply a fixed ratio to them in the way of tax; the payer
knows or may know beforehand precisely how much the
tax will amount to, and consequently just how it is to affect
the profitableness of his current trade; and on these and
other grounds specific taxes are preferable to advalorem
ones. To be sure, this form of tax involves that high-priced
grades of an article pay no higher taxes than low-priced
grades of the same, but this consideration is largely
overbalanced by those of convenience and productiveness.</p>

<p>Advalorem taxes, on the other hand, are never calculable
beforehand; because Values from their nature are variable,
and as a matter of fact do constantly vary. Imported goods,
for instance, bring with them the invoice of the seller giving
the values at the place of exportation. But the importer
is by no means sure that the tax will be levied upon
that valuation. The home valuation will of course be
higher, otherwise the goods would not be imported. Whenever
it becomes the policy of a country, as of the United
States at present, to keep foreign goods <i>out</i> to the utmost
extent possible under the law, which law is itself devised
on purpose to keep them out, there will always be suspicions
and charges of undervaluations at the place of
export; there will always be a motive on the part of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_559" id="Page_559">[559]</a></span>
foreign seller or agent thus to undervalue the goods in the
interest of the importer, so as to lessen his tax, and so
increase the seller's market; such abnormal tariff-taxes are
the enemy of mankind in general, and, therefore, there will
be no end of deceits and evasions at both terminals of the
ocean-route, and "custom-house oaths" will become a by-word
of course; the importing, or rather the non-importing,
country will keep in pay an army of spies and informers on
both sides of the water in order to prevent what is called
"frauds," and another army of "appraisers" at its custom-houses
in order to discredit the invoices, and to jump at a
valuation of the goods, on which the tax shall be levied;
and honorable merchants and importers, without any fault
of their own, are liable to get entangled in the miserable
meshes of such goings-on, as happened in a memorable
case in New York a few years ago, and be mulcted in fines
(perhaps to immense amounts) one-half of which shall go
to the informer.</p>

<p>There are too many practical difficulties connected with
either of these two forms of tax to make it proper to combine
the two upon the same article of merchandise. To
combine them thus is one of the tricks and traps of Protectionism.
That makes it next to impossible for any
importer to tell beforehand what the two taxes will aggregate,
and quite impossible for any ultimate consumer to
tell how much of his price paid is due to the demands of
his Government. Opening the official tax-book at random,
we quote as follows from a single page: "Webbings,
pound 50 cents, and 50 per cent"; "Buttons, pound 50
cents, and 50 per cent"; "Suspenders, pound 50 cents,
and 50 per cent"; "Mohair cloth, pound 30 cents, and 50
per cent"; "Dress trimmings, pound 50 cents, and 50 per
cent." Besides these, on that same page, there are 14
other articles under similar compound taxes, mostly at 50
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_560" id="Page_560">[560]</a></span>
cents a pound and 50 per cent additional, this as under
the Tariff as it was 1874-83; but all these 18 articles were
put in 1883 at "<i>pound 30 cents, and 50 per cent</i>."</p>

<p>9. What are the economical reasons for an <span class="smcap">Excise</span> or
<span class="smcap">Internal-Tax</span> in connection with Tariff-taxes for revenue?
A tariff-tax, whether for revenue or other purpose,
raises the price by so much of the article subjected to it
and actually imported; now, if similar articles of the same
quality be made or grown at home, and be not subjected
to a corresponding tax, these will inevitably rise to the
price of the foreign, with the tariff-tax added, for there is
no possible competition or conceivable impulse that can
keep it lower than that; so that, in that case, the government
gets in revenue, only the taxes paid on the part
imported, while the people are compelled to pay in addition
virtually the same taxes on all that part produced at
home. Why should not the government have the proceeds
of the last as well as of the first? The last is the
direct result of the first. If now, a corresponding excise-tax
be put on the domestic product also, the government
will get in revenue all that the people are obliged to pay
in consequence of government-tax. This is just: the
other is wantonly unjust.</p>

<p>Take an illustration, please. The national Census of
1890 gives the Pig-iron production of the Census year as
9,579,779 tons of 2000 lbs. each. This is an increase over
the production of the Census year, 1880, of 255 <i>per centum</i>,&mdash;3,781,021:9,579,779.
Fortunately the present Census
adds the net imports for the two years respectively,
with these results: the <i>per capita</i> consumption of Pig-iron
in 1880 was 196 lbs., of which 126 was home production,
and 70 of foreign import; while in 1890 the consumption
was 320 lbs. <i>per capita</i>, of which 299 was domestic, and 21
foreign. That is to say, in 1880, 65% of the pig-iron consumed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_561" id="Page_561">[561]</a></span>
in this country was of home production, and 35%
was of foreign production. At that time the tariff-tax on
imported pig was $7 per ton. Government secured this
tax on a little more than one-third of what was consumed,
while a small circle of citizens banded together for that
purpose secured for themselves this tax on the remaining
two-thirds of all pig-iron consumed that year, <i>and the
whole people paid the tax on the entire three-thirds</i>. As we
shall see fully a little further on, our national Government
has no constitutional or other right to tax the people one
penny except to supply its own needs as such; if, therefore,
the $7 impost per ton were put on as a legitimate
tax, there should have been an <i>excise</i> or internal-tax to the
same amount put on the pig-iron produced at home. That
would have cost the people no more, and the Government
would have gotten twice as much more as it did get from
the tax. If there be an axiom in Taxation, one point
indisputable by any rational human being, it is this: <i>The
Treasury should receive all that the people are made to give
up under a public tax.</i></p>

<p>In 1890, this particular matter came to be much more
flagrant. Only 21 parts out of 320 parts were in that year
foreign pig-iron; that is, a little less than 7%, while 93%
was domestic pig-iron; the tariff-tax at that date was .3 of
a cent per pound, or $6.72 per ton of 2240 lbs.; the tax
was sufficient practically to exclude foreign pig, although
the Scotch pig as more fluent is very much desired here
in some branches of the iron manufacture, particularly in
making steel rails; Government received the proceeds of
its own tax on only one-fourteenth of that, which really
paid the tax on its whole fourteen-fourteenths; where did
the tax on the thirteen-thirteenths go to? If this were a
matter of genuine taxation, ought there not to have been
an <i>excise</i> on the domestic corresponding to the <i>impost</i> on
the foreign?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_562" id="Page_562">[562]</a></span></p>

<p>Precisely that is what we do in the case of other articles
not <i>protectionized</i>. For example, in the fiscal year 1889,
the excise or internal-tax on "distilled spirits and wines"
realized to the Treasury $74,312,200, and the tariff-tax on
the same realized $7,123,062, total, $81,435,268; on "malt
or fermented liquors" the same year, the excise was
$23,723,835, the impost only $663,337, total, $24,387,172;
and on "tobacco" the excise was $31,866,860, the impost
$11,194,486, total, $43,061,346. These figures are official.</p>

<p>An ostentatious display of private figures and price-lists
is often made, with a design to show that the prices of
home-made products protectionized are not lifted so high
to consumers or buyers as those of foreign-made products
with the tariff-taxes added. The main sophistry in these
figures is this: the pure assumption, that the <i>quality</i> of
the home-made products alleged to be cheaper than the
tax-added price of the foreign, is <i>the same</i> as that of the
foreign. Unluckily, things are often called by the same
names, and even described by the same technical terms,
which are very different sorts of things in reality. A
subordinate sophistry in these figures, often allowed to
pass, but not requiring any sharp insight to detect, is, that
the selected price-lists are not the results of an average
extending throughout years, but are <i>picked</i> at points when
(owing to other causes than the taxes) the current prices
of protectionized home products are lower than the average
of the years. One easy way to expose the putters-forth of
these figures, as not themselves really believing in them,
is, gravely to propose to lower or remove the tariff-taxes,
which (it is alleged) do not have the effect to lift much, if
any, domestic prices. This simple experiment has several
times been tried, with ludicrous effect upon the figure-mongers;
they cannot spare one iota of present taxes on
foreign products: if the smallest fraction be removed, they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_563" id="Page_563">[563]</a></span>
can no longer make and vend their wares; indeed, heavier
tariff-taxes are needed at this very moment, in order to lift
the domestic prices higher; and, presto! another set of
figures are forthcoming at once to prove the disabilities,
either in respect to Labor or Capital, under which the poor
protectionized producers are staggering in order to keep
the home market!</p>

<p>Another complete refutation of the false position of the
protectionists, namely, that the domestics are not lifted in
price on the average to the price of the foreigns of the
same quality with the tariff-taxes added, is their utter
failure and inability to project any reason in the nature of
things or the motives of men, why the <i>home-prices should</i>
<span class="smcap">not</span> <i>be thus lifted</i>! What impulse, pray, on the earth or
under the earth, can serve to depress them on the whole
average <i>below</i> that point? Does any one say, that "domestic
competition" will depress and keep depressed the prices
of home goods of the same grade below the prices of the
foreign taxes paid? Did this astute objector ever hear of
"domestic combination" to keep prices up to the highest
possible point? To shut down mills and factories, to avoid
depressing prices? To sell surplus stocks abroad for what
can be gotten for them, in order to make prices at home up
to the usual scarcity point? In July, 1890, the Boston
Commercial Bulletin, the special organ of Protectionism in
New England, and special spokesman for the wool-and-woollens
industry, spoke thus of that industry, after 30 years
of public hiring the growers and manufacturers to carry
it on with a <i>bonus</i>, just at a time when the worsted tariff-taxes
had been advanced, alleged custom-house frauds
stopped, and still higher tariff-taxes on their way from the
so-called McKinley Bill in Congress: "<i>The woollen goods
industry was probably never in much worse condition in this
country. The slowness of its development may be judged</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_564" id="Page_564">[564]</a></span>
<i>from the fact, that, despite an average yearly increase of over
a million in population, the increase in the number of wool
cards in this country is less than a hundred a year, while the
proportion of woollen machinery shut down between June 1
and September 1 bids fair to be the largest ever known. The
market is dull, deadly dull. The large amount of silent
machinery is making its presence felt. The sluggish sales of
wool are due to most of the big mills being closed. Depression
in business is the cause of so many woollen mills closing, and
the news comes this week of four woollen mills, three in the
Bay State and one in Pennsylvania, that will close for
periods ranging from two weeks to several months.</i>"</p>

<p>Not only is it true, that the purpose and usual effect of
tariff-taxes is to hoist the price of domestics protectionized
up to the limit of the corresponding foreigns with the taxes
added, but it sometimes happens that the home products
are carried for considerable periods at a level a good deal
above that. A conspicuous instance of this, commented on
at the time by all the Boston papers, was brought to notice
a couple of years ago in connection with the steel beams
purchased by the city for the new and noble Boston Court-House.
The beams were bought in Belgium at $28 a ton,
paid at the Boston Custom-house "<i>one and one-fourth cents
a pound</i>," that is, just $28 a ton, making their cost to the
city $56 a ton. But domestic steel beams of the same general
description were selling here at $73 a ton. Their
price had been raised here twice in one summer, about fifty
cents a ton each time. One of the conglomerated curses
of cutting off by law the natural competition in such products
is, that the unnatural competition still permitted by
law is sluggish in coming into operation, and the monopoly
becomes even more such than was intended by the law.</p>

<p>The tariff-tax on steel rails is $17 a ton, formerly $28 a
ton, proposed in the McKinley bill to be reduced to $11.20
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_565" id="Page_565">[565]</a></span>
a ton. That even this last is wholly needless, or any tax
at all on steel rails, is proven by the fact, that in March,
1890, Pittsburg rail-makers sold 5000 tons of rails at Vera
Cruz at lower prices than the corresponding European
rails were offered for in Mexico. Another fact that proves
the same thing is this: James M. Swank, the mouth-piece
of the Pennsylvania iron and steel interests, describes the
year 1885 as one of unprecedented prosperity in the steel-rail
industry, and gives a formidable list of new establishments
opened in that year. But steel rails were much
lower in that exceptional year than in any year before or
since. A tariff-tax of $5 a ton would have been in that
year absolutely prohibitory, for steel rails were worth less
than $28 a ton the greater part of that year. Yet that
very year was the year of greatest prosperity, Mr. Swank
being the competent witness! But the fact in general,
which ought to overwhelm the iron and steel protectionists
with confusion, if they were capable of any such emotion,
is, that iron and steel in every form of both, owing to the
unprecedented bounty of God to this good land, costs less
both in labor and capital here than in any other country
in the world. The official figures of the current Census
demonstrate this, authentic statements of practical operators
at the iron mines and furnaces and foundries throughout
the Tennessee Valley confirm it, and there is not one
particle of evidence to the contrary of any name or nature.</p>

<p>Let the reader notice carefully the following quotation
from a private letter to the writer, dated July 30, 1890,
written by a graduate of this college, in whom all who
know him have the fullest confidence:</p>

<p>"<i>We began to open the mines here just three years ago this
Fall, and began shipping the following Spring. Our price
for the ore was then about $1.50 a ton, depending on the
analysis. We mined in the old-fashioned way&mdash;with picks</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_566" id="Page_566">[566]</a></span>
<i>and shovels&mdash;and I am safe in saying it cost us all we
got for it. I know I was continually making drafts on my
father to keep me out of debt. I did not figure on the
cost at that time&mdash;I was afraid of the figures. My only
thought was how to reduce the cost. We had a Steam
Shovel in Pennsylvania, and I got my father to send it to me
for trial in this ore. We found we could use it to advantage
by using also plenty of powder, and I was soon able to buy the
second shovel. Of course that reduced the cost of production
still lower, and as there was a market for all I could do, I got
the third, and am now putting in the fourth, and the fifth is
bought and to be delivered inside of 60 days. This doubling
up of the shovels made me get locomotives to carry the ore in
the mines instead of mules. I have now two locomotives.
You will understand how it would make a saving at that
point. It would require 15 mules to do that work, and it
could not be done so promptly.</i></p>

<p><i>During the month of May we shipped about 14,500 tons
with the use of three shovels, and at a cost per ton for labor
and fuel and powder of 33 cents. We have reduced the cost
on a week's run, in good weather and with no lack of empty
cars, to 29 cents, but it never came lower on the month's average
than 33. I expect this Fall, with five shovels instead of
three, and two locomotives instead of one, to lower the cost of
production.</i></p>

<p><i>Our average price at the mines is $1.20; we sell some
higher. I have just now taken a contract for 40,000 tons to
be delivered between now and the 1st of February, 1891, at
$1.12&#189;. This is the lowest contract price we have ever made,
and likely that has ever been made in this locality; but I did
it to get into a different market. That ore is to go to Nashville&mdash;a
distance of 120 miles. The reason for cutting the
price to get the increased quantity I will not need to explain
to you. You taught it to me. The freight to Nashville is</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_567" id="Page_567">[567]</a></span>
<i>75 cents. To our other furnaces in Alabama, at Sheffield and
Florence, the freight is only 35 cents. What other contracts
I have at present are at $1.25.</i></p>

<p><i>With three shovels we make from 600 to 800 tons a day.
With one shovel we made from 150 to 250 a day. The variation
from day to day depends on the quality of the material
we handle.</i></p>

<p><i>The ore is all washed and picked and screened before it is
loaded on the cars. A very important part of the work is
the work done in the washer. It requires very expensive machinery,
and the wear and tear is enormous.</i></p>

<p><i>We pay unskilled laborers ten cents an hour, skilled men
as high as twenty-five. We work eleven hours a day. Our
general foreman gets $100 a month.</i>"</p>

<p>Sugar and Molasses brought in through the tariff in the
fiscal year 1889, $55,995,137. The quantity of domestic
sugar and molasses relatively to the quantity imported is
so small, that an excise upon it in accordance with the
general principle of these paragraphs is not worth while,
but would be far more just and rational than to offer bounties
to the domestic producers out of the taxes paid by the
consumers of foreign sugar. A "bounty" in this sense is
at once an abuse of a good word, and an abomination in
point of fact. For any Government, which is nothing but
a Committee of all the citizens to attend to certain joint
concerns of all, to abstract money through taxes from the
pockets of a part of these citizens in order to reward another
part for carrying on an unprofitable branch of business, is
something equally repugnant to Economy and Equality.</p>

<p>10. What, then, is the <span class="smcap">Bottom-Principle</span> in the Mode
of Taxation? It is this: <i>Relatively low taxes so adjusted
on comparatively few things as not to disturb natural prices</i>.
The principle is simple: the problem is difficult; but wonderfully
less so the moment all attempts are given up to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_568" id="Page_568">[568]</a></span>
foster any branch of industry whatever. Our legislators are
not called upon to foster any industries. It is out of their
beat. They cannot permanently do it, if they try; and
they do immense harm while they try. Their "bounty,"
instead of being a gift, as the word imports, is a haphazard
bestowment of other people's money extorted from them by
public taxes. The problem becomes simpler every year of
public experience under the practical design of so laying
the public burdens as to realize to the Treasury the most
money with the least possible interference with what would
otherwise be the on-going of Exchanges in all directions.
So relatively simple and easy has the English taxing
system become, under this one leading design, that Gladstone
performed without difficulty the functions of Chancellor
of the Exchequer in conjunction with the far more
arduous and complicated duties of Prime Minister.</p>

<p><i>Low taxes on few things.</i> The opposite of this principle
at either of its two points becomes at once pernicious. High
taxes in general prevent exchanges altogether, by cutting
in too deeply in the gain of them, which is the sole motive
to them; high imposts prevent importations, and of course
destroy the profitable exportations consequent to, and conditioned
on, such importations; high taxes even on few
things are apt to raise prices of other articles than those on
which they are directly levied, and so become objectionable
always, and unbearable whenever it is their purpose to raise
such prices: taxes on many things, and even on few things
every time they change hands, throw an indefinite burden
on Exchange, whose weight cannot well be calculated
beforehand, either by the consumer or by the government,
through uncertainty as to the number of transfers. Once
for all, and then an end. Exchanges are indeed the only
legitimate subject of taxation, but not every specific and
subordinate exchange. An attempt to tax all sales whatever
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_569" id="Page_569">[569]</a></span>
was followed in Spain, and will be followed everywhere,
by a sluggish indisposition to trade at all. Let the
amount of the tax be definite, and let everybody be sure
that when it is once paid government will produce no further
claim, and industry will go along under heavy taxes
better than under those nominally lighter to which uncertainty
as to time or amount attaches. All the more advanced
governments have been simplifying of late years
their systems of taxation, and collecting their revenue at
fewer points, and under more tangible conditions, in order
to interfere as little as possible with a free industry and
free exchange.</p>

<p>The subsidiary principle is important, namely, that all
taxes should be collected by the government in as economical
a manner as possible, inasmuch as all direct and indirect
costs of collection are so much added to the burdens
of the People. This covers two practical points: (1) the
number and efficiency of the tax-gatherers, and the whole
outward machinery of collection, such as the custom-houses,
offices of internal revenue, and so on. These, as they
concern the whole people equally, should be separated as
far as possible from party politics, and the inevitable corruptions
thereupon attendant. All the fiscal officers of the
United States, from the Secretary of the Treasury down to
the lowest tide-waiter, are liable to be changed every four
years, and as a matter of fact are usually to a very large
extent so changed, to the great detriment of the service and
ultimate expense of the people, to say nothing of the moral
losses and crevasses involved. (2) The tax-money should
be kept out of the pockets of the people as short a time as
possible, disbursement following quick upon collection. It
is poor policy to gather taxes at the beginning of the year
which will not be disbursed till the end of the year. Let
the people use their funds till they are wanted at the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_570" id="Page_570">[570]</a></span>
treasury; and if the taxes do not then come in as fast as
wanted, it is better to issue what are called in England
exchequer-bills, and in the United States certificates of
indebtedness, to be redeemed at the end of the year from
the proceeds of the taxes, than to let the people's money
lie idle in the treasury. The Secretary of the Treasury
should have nothing to do or say about the circulating
medium of the country, or the loanable price of the units
of it, under any circumstances whatever. He is neither
competent enough in Knowledge nor enough established
in Integrity to be trusted with any such functions.</p>

<p>11. Should there be any <span class="smcap">exemptions</span> from Taxation?
If the necessities of the State require it, government has
the right to demand from all persons who are capable of
making exchanges, and who do make them, something
in the form of taxes. But it is every way better, when
possible, that people of very moderate means should be
exempted altogether from direct taxes; and the payment
of indirect taxes is a matter more in their own option,
since they are at liberty to buy much or little of those
commodities subjected to an indirect tax. In the State of
Massachusetts, incomes not exceeding $2000 are exempted
by the law. If a house-tax should be levied, all houses
below a certain grade of style and comfort should be exempted,
and the tax pass up by easy gradations from those
just taxed to the palatial residences of the rich. In the
present age of the world, the well-to-do citizens of every
country are able to bear without too great difficulty the
burdens of the government, and nothing tests better the
degree of civilization which a nation has reached than
the care and solicitude it displays for the welfare of its
poorer citizens.</p>

<p>12. Who pays the <span class="smcap">indirect taxes</span>? At a court ball,
Napoleon the First once observed a lady noticeable as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_571" id="Page_571">[571]</a></span>
richly dressed and as wearing splendid diamonds, and on
asking her name, found that she was the wife of a tobacco
manufacturer of Paris; it occurred at once to the quick
mind of the French ruler, that the State might just as well
have those profits as an individual; and the sale of tobacco
in all its forms became accordingly a State monopoly,
which now yields about 400,000,000 francs a year. That
is indirect taxation. So is the British and United States
tariff and excise on tobacco. Producers and dealers and
bankers and companies add the tax demanded from them,
and sometimes more than the tax under color of it, to the
price of their wares. But it is not true that they can always
realize the whole of this enhanced price. Generally they
can, sometimes they cannot. If the article be one of necessity,
or a luxury that has become equivalent to a necessity,
and there be no other source of supply than the taxed
one, then, as a rule, the tax falls wholly on the consumer,
and is a matter of indifference to the producer or dealer.
But the usual effect of an enhanced price is to lessen demand,
and if the article is dispensable, or its consumption
can be lessened, or it can be obtained elsewhere, the market
will be sluggish under the tax, and producers or dealers
will be likely to tempt it by lowering prices, in other
words, by sharing the tax with consumers, and paying
that share out of profits. This is the principle. Producers
and dealers would rather the tax were off. Consumers
generally, but do not always, pay the whole of it.</p>

<p>13. What is to be said about the <span class="smcap">diffusion</span> of Taxes?
David A. Wells, an admirable and indefatigable authority
on all practical questions in Economics, though perhaps
less skilled in scientific classification and generalizations,
several years ago made somewhat prominent in public
discussion the tendency of Taxes <i>to diffuse themselves</i>.
Much more has been written about this than is actually
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_572" id="Page_572">[572]</a></span>
known about it. By Diffusion is meant that it does not
make so much difference upon what or upon whom a tax
is originally levied, because the tendency of things is to
<i>diffuse it</i>, that is, to compel others to assist in paying the
tax. The result of much personal reading and reflection
on this point is the conclusion that taxes do not "diffuse
themselves" nearly so much as has been sometimes supposed;
and that, at any rate, it is a good deal better to
take the taxes from those who ought to pay them, than to
lay them at random, and then to trust some unknown
forces to make them afterwards just. It is certain that
<i>some</i> unjust taxes cannot be diffused; for example, the
protective tariff-taxes paid by the farmers upon articles
of necessary consumption. These taxes have no tendency
to raise the price of the farmers' produce, for <i>that</i> is
determined by the foreign market, to which large parts
of the produce are exported. For such taxes the farmers
cannot reimburse themselves. Taxes that affect no prices
are the best of all; taxes that affect prices the least are
the next best; and taxes that are <i>designed</i> to affect prices
are the very worst.</p>

<p>14. What are the bearings of the <span class="smcap">United States Constitution</span>
on the whole matter of Taxation in this country?
We have now seen pretty fully, what the science of
Economics has to say about the sources and modes and
results of tax-laying: but we are bound to tell also, what
the kindred but much less developed science of Politics,
and particularly what the Constitution of the Fathers, has
to say upon the same vitally important topics.</p>

<p>(1) The first power granted by the People to Congress,
which is simply their agent, in that Instrument from which
each of the three great Departments of Government derives
all its authority, is in these words, exactly copied
from the original and official parchment in every particular:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_573" id="Page_573">[573]</a></span>
"<i>The Congress shall have Power to lay and collect
Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises, to pay the Debts and
provide for the common Defence and general Welfare of the
United States; but all Duties, Imposts and Excises shall be
uniform throughout the United States.</i>" This grant of
power, which stands first in order, is followed by seventeen
other express powers granted to Congress in the same
eighth Section of the first Article.</p>

<p>There never has been any difference of opinion, and
there cannot be under such completely explicit language
as this, among competent Statesmen and Commentators,
as to the exact meaning of this clause, namely, Congress
is given power to lay taxes in order to get money, with
which to pay the debts and provide for the common defence
and general welfare of the United States. That was
the opinion and purpose of every member of the Federal
Convention, that framed the Constitution in the summer
of 1787; of Alexander Hamilton, who was first called on
as Secretary of the Treasury officially to interpret it; of
Daniel Webster, often called the "great expounder" of the
Constitution; of John Marshall, the great Chief Justice of
the Supreme Court; of Judge Story, the first copious and
most distinguished commentator upon the Text; of George
Bancroft and George T. Curtis, the learned and elaborate
historians of the Text; and in short, of everybody else,
who has earned any right in any way to have an opinion
on any such matter of political interpretation.</p>

<p>Why, then, has there been from the first until now, a
feeble flutter of butterfly wings around the clause, as if,
somehow or other, it gave Congress by hook or by crook
some power or other to do something <i>else</i> than to lay taxes
in order to get money for the maintenance of the national
Government? As if there lay concealed in the language
somewhere a power to lay taxes for a purpose precisely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_574" id="Page_574">[574]</a></span>
opposite to that expressed in the text, namely, <i>nominal
taxes designed to prohibit any money being gotten under
them</i>? And why did Hamilton himself, whose wings were
those of an eagle, sweep low and hover uncertainly about
these words, and so give color to the political historians of
our time to say: "<i>Once more laying hold of the "general
welfare" clause of the Constitution, Hamilton here argued,
under color of giving bounties to manufactures, as though
Congress might take under its own management every thing
which that body should pronounce to be for the general welfare,
provided only it was susceptible of the application of
money. Though he limited this central discretion to the
application of money, and stated some restrictions rather
vaguely, the insidious tenor of his report was to show that
the Federal power of raising money was plenary and indefinitely
great.</i>"</p>

<p>The true answer to these questions is a point of Grammar.
The simple English infinitive, unlike the simple
infinitive of any other language with which the writer is
acquainted, <i>often expresses purpose</i>, as well as the action of
the verb without limitation of person or number; so that,
it is perfectly good English to say, "To lay taxes to pay,"
when the only possible sense of it is, "To lay taxes <i>in
order to pay</i>." Greek, Latin, and German would use here
with the infinitive the particle expressing the purpose:
the English language does not. It is not true to say, that
ambiguity enters this clause, through the common and
elegant use of the simple infinitive in English to express
the purpose; but it <i>is</i> true to say, that superficial confusion
has entered here, and a mess of bad logic. What makes
it absolutely certain, beyond the possibility of a controversy,
that Congress can levy taxes only in order to get
money by means of them, is, (a) that is the only English
of the clause; (b) the "debts" of the United States can
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_575" id="Page_575">[575]</a></span>
only be paid in money; and (c) if this be <i>not</i> the meaning
of the clause, its meaning must then be plenary, and there
would be no need or place for the remaining seventeen
powers, "and all other powers vested by this Constitution
in the Government of the United States or in any Department
or Officer thereof"; in other words, any other interpretation
of the taxing clause than the plain one would
destroy the Constitution root and branch; for, if Congress
have the general power "to pay the debts and provide for
the common defence and general welfare of the United
States," all other possible powers are included in this,
and President and Court disappear, and all other clauses
of the Text are a nullity.</p>

<p>If the above course of reasoning be sound, and he would
be a bold logician who should openly dispute it, then taxes
laid for any other end than revenue are clearly unconstitutional.
The Supreme Court has never passed upon this
bald point, for it has never been mooted in this form; but
one would think, there can be little doubt how the judges
would decide in any "case" directly involving the constitutional
power of Congress to levy prohibitory tariff-taxes,
whose avowed or clearly inferrible design it is, <i>not</i>
to get money with which to pay the debts and so on, but
to cut off the possibility of getting any money thereby.
The general trend of the decisions of the Supreme Court
has wisely been, to leave in their interpretations of the
Text the widest margin of discretion to the Legislative
branch as to the best means of <i>raising</i> revenue; but when
it comes to face the question of allowing as constitutional
the best means of <i>preventing</i> revenue,&mdash;well, may we be
there to see and hear!</p>

<p>(2) There are prohibitions on Congress in the Constitution,
as well as powers conferred, and among these this:
"<i>No tax or duty shall be laid on Articles exported from any</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_576" id="Page_576">[576]</a></span>
<i>State.</i>" This is a part of the third great Compromise of
the Constitution, and was a concession to the southern and
planting States to make more palatable to them the power
"to regulate commerce," that was expected to be used
(and was used) in behalf of the northern and navigating
States. But the concession was more nominal than real,
as the southerners found out in time to their vexation.
To prohibit taxes on exports, and to leave in full vigor the
power to tax imports, though consonant with the then prevailing
delusion of Mercantilism, is no boon to commerce
in general; because, any restriction on buying products is
equally and instantly a restriction on selling products.
Exemption from taxes on exports is a good thing in itself,
but the only reason for selling exports is to take in profitable
pay the imports naturally offered against them; and if
these be restricted or prohibited, the restriction or prohibition
applies instantaneously and inevitably to the would-be
exports. A reasonable liberty of exporting is nothing,
unless accompanied by a reasonable liberty of importing,
because the imports pay for the exports and the exports
buy the imports.</p>

<p>The southern States rejoiced for a time in this exemption-clause
of the Constitution, for their rice and cotton
and indigo found no obstacles in going out; but the only
motive in sending them out was to buy something with
them to bring back; and after the snare of Protectionism
entangled the People in 1816, 1824, and specially in 1828,
when the "Tariff of Abominations" was passed, the
southern people saw only too distinctly, that taxes on
imports which they wished to bring in were the same in
effect as taxes on their own exports would have been.
Mr. Calhoun and the others were effectually undeceived
by the customary on-goings of commerce; and as the
northern statesmen unwisely and unpatriotically determined
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_577" id="Page_577">[577]</a></span>
to crowd this iron home in 1828, the party of the
other part developed under great provocation the doctrines
of Nullification and Secession, which have since caused a
plenty of tears and bloodshed. One wrong ever begets
other wrongs. The wretched Greed of one section of the
country was own father to the wrongful Secession of the
other section.</p>

<p>The Farmers of this country have often been congratulated
on their privilege under the constitution of exporting
their agricultural products without a tax. The congratulation
is hollow. Of what use is it to go out free and
come back manacled? The ultimate is always the return-service.
The farmers are cheated. Their agricultural
exports are falling off year by year solely in consequence
of outrageous tariff-taxes on imports. In 1881, farmers'
produce was exported to the amount of $730,394,943, and
that was not one-half what it would have been under a
simple and adequate Tariff for Revenues; but in 1889,
these exports only reached $532,141,490, a falling off of
nearly $200,000,000. This decline was chiefly in meats
and breadstuffs. No wonder the farmers have been complaining
of terribly hard times of late years: no wonder
they are organizing "Alliances" and other machinery for
reaching a remedy: they must see clearly first where the
disease lies: the truth is, they are tariff-taxed to death:
their foes are they of their own household: Vermont, a
purely agricultural State, is the only one in the Union,
that has actually <i>retrograded</i> in property and population
in the last census-decade: those excellent people have
hugged the Tariff-delusion to their ruin; their senior Senator,
whose name is unpleasantly connected with the national
tax-laws of a generation, has never yet in the course
of a long and reputable life gained a glimmer of the commercial
truth,&mdash;if men <i>will</i> not buy they <i>can</i> not sell.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_578" id="Page_578">[578]</a></span></p>

<p>(3) The only other clause of the Constitution, which, as
students of Taxation, we are bound to examine, is the following:
"<i>No Capitation, or other direct, Tax shall be laid,
unless in Proportion to the Census or Enumeration herein
before directed to be taken.</i>" A capitation tax is a poll-tax,
which may be easily "proportioned" to the Census. It is
not clear, what is the meaning of the words "or other
direct tax"; the Supreme Court early struggled with that
question, to this apparent result, that <i>lands</i>, as the only
form of property that can be "proportioned" in their
appraised value to population with any considerable degree
of accuracy, are the only "other" subject of "direct"
Taxation. However this may be, it is of considerable consequence
to note, that the term, "direct tax," as used in
the Constitution, does not correspond in its meaning to the
significance of the same term as employed in Economics.
With us, a "direct tax" means one demanded from and
paid by the person on whom it is ostensibly levied, and
cannot be thrown off or forward on anybody else; while
an "indirect tax" is one which can be so thrown off or
forward.</p>

<p>Attention is called to the distinction here, in order to
show that an Income-tax, while in the Economical sense it
is a "direct tax," is not such in the sense of the Constitution.
Objections were urged against the late Income-tax
in this country, that it was a "direct tax," and so, because
it could not be proportioned to the population, was unconstitutional.
The point is not well taken. It remains, and
will remain, after the most searching scrutiny, that an
universal Income-tax, all other taxes being abolished, is
the form most consonant with the principles of Political
Economy, and not at all repugnant to the Constitution of
the United States.</p>

<p>15. Finally, are there any hints and guides to thought
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_579" id="Page_579">[579]</a></span>
and legislation in the matter of Taxation through an
extremely brief summary of the <span class="smcap">History</span> of Taxes? So
far as the Greeks are concerned, they showed a practical
good sense in their laws of Property in general, and in their
laws relating to Taxes in particular. The natural march
of industry and commerce was not hindered by taxation:
there was no forbidding the export of raw materials or
specie; no favoring of manufactures at the expense of agriculture;
no hint of the future Mercantilism in any efforts
to preserve an artificial balance of trade; and no taxes on
imports except for purposes of Revenue. These at Athens
itself were usually 2% of the value of the goods, at the
ports of her subject-allies 5%, and exceptional cases of
higher rates than these were regarded as extortionate.</p>

<p>The Romans also were sensible and moderate in their
modes of Taxation. They laid taxes for the sake of getting
money for the public treasury, and had no other end in
view. They knew nothing of what has since become
famous under the name of "Protectionism." Their taxes
were both direct and indirect, but especially the latter.
The chief direct tax was the land-tax, that is, a claim to
the tenth part of the sheaves and of other field produce,
such as grapes and olives; and also pasture-money (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">scriptura</i>)
demanded of those who made use of the public
pastures and woods. In Macedonia and the other larger
Provinces, in lieu of the land-tax a fixed sum of money
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tributum</i>) was paid to Rome each year by each community
in its own way. The grain-tenths and pasture-moneys
were always farmed out to private contractors or companies
on condition of their paying fixed quantities of grain or
fixed sums of money. The chief indirect tax was customs-duties.
There never was at any time a general tariff for
the whole empire, but there were customs-districts, such as
Italy, Sicily, proconsular Asia, the province of Narbo in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_580" id="Page_580">[580]</a></span>
Gaul, and others, each with a sort of tariff of its own, and
some with special immunities. Goods imported by sea into
Italy, for example, not for the personal use of the importer,
were subject to a tax, which seems to have been mainly a
tax on luxuries, since pepper, cinnamon, myrrh, ginger,
perfumes, ivory and diamonds, are among the dutiable
goods mentioned in one of these tariffs. Sicily had a tariff-tax
quite distinct from this, since one-twentieth of the
value of the goods (5%) was levied on the frontier on <i>all</i>
imports and exports; and a similar tax of one-fortieth was
laid by the Sempronian law on the province of Asia.
These imposts, too, were leased to contractors, which gave,
of course, some chance of fraud and wrong. There were
other temporary taxes, like those, for instance, which
Augustus laid of 5% on legacies and inheritances, and of
1% on articles publicly exposed for sale.</p>

<p>Green's History of England (I., 322 <i>et seq.</i>) gives an
outline of the taxes there from the beginning of the monarchy.
As land was almost the only source of salable
things in the early time, so it was almost the only thing on
which taxes were levied. Danegeld and scutage and feudal
aids fastened only on the land. "But a new principle of
taxation was disclosed in the tithe levied for a Crusade at
the close of Henry Second's reign. Land was no longer
the only source of wealth. The growth of national prosperity,
of trade and commerce, was creating a mass of
personal property which offered irresistible temptations to
the Angevin financiers. No usage fettered the Crown in
dealing with personal property, and its growth in value
promised a growing revenue. Grants of from a seventh
to a thirtieth of movables, household property, and stock
were demanded. The right of the king to grant licenses
to bring goods into or to trade within the realm, a right
springing from the need of his protection, felt by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_581" id="Page_581">[581]</a></span>
strangers who came there for purposes of traffic, laid the
foundation for our taxes on imports. Those on exports
were only a part of the general system of taxing personal
property. How tempting this source of revenue was proving,
we see from a provision of the Great Charter, which
forbids the levy of more than the ancient customs on merchants
entering or leaving the realm. Commerce was in
fact growing with the growing wealth of the people." This
passage shows, that, as a matter of fact, <i>taxes</i> have always
hinged, and must hinge, on <i>trade</i>.</p>

<p>A few facts in the most recent movements of national
Taxation in the United States may fitly conclude this
Chapter and this Volume. Since 1867, Wool and Woollens
have been the ass, upon whose breaking back the most conspicuous
burdens have been piled; and the "McKinley
Bill" so-called, still pending at the present writing in the
Senate, heaps up still higher the groaning loads. The following
table shows how futile is the attempt to keep out
wools and woollens from such a country as ours, even by the
most exaggerated barriers:&mdash;</p>

<p>Roger Q. Mills of Texas stated from his place in the
House of Representatives in 1888, that the United States
grows but about 265,000,000 lbs. of wool yearly, while it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_582" id="Page_582">[582]</a></span>
takes about 600,000,000 lbs. to clothe our own people.
Why should more than half the wool needed to clothe the
people be taxed in such a way as to double (in general)
the cost of the people's clothing? And why should Benjamin
Harrison, now President of the United States, have said
in that same year, in view of these elsewhere unheard-of
taxes, and in view of the average climate of his country,
that somehow it seemed to him <i>that cheap clothing implied
a cheap man</i>? In view of the enormous natural demand
for woollens, in order to keep comfortable day and night
64,000,000 of inhabitants, is it not strange, and must there
not be artificial causes for it in the kind and mode of
national Taxation, that the United States has but 16 sheep
to the square mile, while Germany has 92, France 111, and
Great Britain 339?</p>

<p>Senator John Sherman stated in his place in August, 1888,
and again in substance Sept. 2, 1890, that a line of custom-houses
on our joint-frontier with Canada was "<i>the height
of nonsense, and almost a crime against civilization</i>." Well
might he say this in view of what his colleague, Allison of
Iowa, has recently said, namely, that the Dominion bought
in 1880 of the United States 8% of its brass goods, 86%
of its copper manufactures, 94% of its cordage, 88% of its
gingham, 65% of its glasswares, 99% of its rubber goods,
94% of its printing ink, 92% of wooden wares, 91% of tinware,
90% of wall-paper, 72% of paper wares, 98% of
ploughs, 97% of engines, 99% of sewing-machines, and
90% of miscellaneous machinery.</p>

last two fiscal years are as follows:

<p>There two or three noticeable points from this table.
First, the large relative increase of free imports over those
of former years. Free articles in 1867 were less than 5%
of the whole; in 1882, 30%; and in 1890, 33.9%. The
Free List, so-called, has indeed been enlarged in the interval,
but free goods tend naturally to swell over the taxed
goods, so that in 1890 the free were almost exactly one-half
of the taxed. Second, of the large total of merchandise
exports, it is to be sorrowfully noted, that more than
82% of the whole is made up of the products of agriculture
and forests and mines (not gold and silver); while
manufactures compose only 17.8%. What ails our manufactures,
that we cannot sell them abroad? We have
been for 30 years under a vaunted scheme warranted to
develop manufactures,&mdash;expressly designed and recommended
to make them cheap and good,&mdash;under an elaborate
and artificial scheme that makes everything bend,
even the backs of the toiling millions, to foster and propel
manufactures! But we do not succeed in selling much of
them abroad, except some fractions of them to Canada.
The ratio of them to the total of exports of merchandise
seems to be growing less: in 1889, 18.9%; in 1890, 17.8%.</p>

<p>The simple truth is, that we are able to sell abroad even
this beggarly proportion of manufactures to the total
exports of merchandise, only in consequence of a shrewd
device working within the Grand Device, namely, the so-called
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_584" id="Page_584">[584]</a></span>
"Free List." Some of the little wheels within the
big wheel revolve rapidly. Manufacturers do not like to
pay protectionist tariff-taxes <i>themselves</i> any better than
other people like to pay them. They have by their own
open confession in overt act precisely the same opinion of
their deadening influence, that other people have. If,
however, they can escape such taxes on the things they
have to buy, especially their raw material, and <i>keep</i> them
on their own finished goods offered for sale in a monopoly
market, they would be happy. Hence, the Free List.
Hear Senator Dawes before the Paper-makers' Convention
at Saratoga in 1887: "<i>There is one other feature of tariff
revision much discussed at the present time which must not
escape our attention, and that is free raw material. No
industrial policy will promote the highest prosperity of both
labor and capital in this country, which fails to lay down
the raw material at the door of the manufactory at the lowest
possible cost. In any new revision of the tariff this rule of
preference for our own raw material must be adhered to by
those who do not propose to give up the American for the
indifferent policy in legislating between ourselves and foreigners.</i>
<span class="smcap">It will be found, however, to add very
few raw materials to the free list, for the revisions
of 1874 and 1883 have already made free all
such non-competing raw materials as at the time
of the passage of those acts were entering to any
considerable extent into the consumption or production
of the country.</span>"</p>

<p>Till now, we have been dealing in facts, and figures, and
in careful generalizations after the inductive manner: let
us, at the very last, indulge in a freak of fancy. Suppose
for a moment, that all taxes of every name could be
abolished instantaneously, and the Governments, like the
Israelites, live on manna for forty years. What harm
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_585" id="Page_585">[585]</a></span>
would ensue? What industry would decline? Who
would be impoverished? What stimulus to work and
save and grow rich would be weakened thereby? Would
not wages, and profits, and rents, all be lifted thereby, with
no damage to anybody? A child can see that Taxes from
their very nature are a burden, are a subtraction from
income, are a <i>minus</i> and not a <i>plus</i>. Who, then, except
from sinister motives, can imagine and represent, that
Taxes are a good in themselves, a positive blessing, a spur
to the progress of Society?</p>

<p>Taxes of some sort there must be for the maintenance
of Governments, which are established for the good of
all. Why, then, should not the Taxes be just as few, just
as simple, just as comprehensible, just as universal and
equitable, as is consonant with the single end of their existence
at all?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_586" id="Page_586">[586]</a></span></p>

<p>Prof. Perry's most elementary text-book, Introduction
to Political Economy, presents the subjects of Value,
Production, Commerce, Money, Credit, and Taxation, in
a way plain and easily grasped by young minds, but at
the same time scientifically exact. In his preface the
author says: "I have endeavored so to lay the foundations
of Political Economy in their whole circuit, that they will
never need to be disturbed afterwards by persons resorting
to it for their early instruction, however long and
however far these persons may pursue their studies in this
science."</p>

<blockquote><p>"This work is not meant in any way to take the place of its author's
larger treatise, but rather to occupy a field which, in the nature of the case,
that work cannot occupy. It is not an abridgment of that work but a
separate treatise, intended primarily for the use of students and readers
whose time for study is small, but who wish to learn the broad principles of
the science thoroughly and well, especially with reference to the scientific
principles which are involved in the practical discussions of our time....
We need scarcely add, with respect to a writer so well known as he,
that his thinking is sound as well as acute, or that his doctrines are those
which the greatest masters of political science have approved."</p>

<p class="center spaced space-above"><big>POLITICAL ECONOMY.</big><br />

Eighteenth Edition.<br />

<i>Rewritten and Enlarged, 1 vol., Crown 8vo. $2.50.</i></p>

<p>This book has passed through several revisions, to the
most thorough of which it was subjected in 1883. It has
grown in size, in symmetry and in maturity of thought
and expression, so that it is a complete exposition of the
science, both historically and topically. The distinctive
feature of the work is its discarding the term <i>Wealth</i> and
making <i>Value</i> the subject of the science. Original light
is thrown on the vexed questions of Land, Money, and
Credit, and the whole trend of the book is on the side of
sound currency and unrestricted trade.</p>

<p>Professor Perry's style is admirably clear and racy; his
illustrations are forcible and well chosen, and he has made
a subject interesting and open to the comprehension of
any diligent student, which has often been left by writers
vague and befogged and bewildering. This work has
stood excellently the test of the class room, and has been
adopted by many of the chief educational institutions in
this country. Among them are Yale College, Bowdoin
College, Dartmouth, Trinity, Wesleyan, University of
Wooster, Dennison University, Rutgers College, New
York University, Union College, Seton Hall College,
Hampden-Sidney, and many other colleges and normal
and high schools.</p>

<p class="center">CRITICAL NOTICES.</p>

<blockquote><p>"This edition has the marks of mature power and complete grasp of the
subject, and that finished style in which thought and language have become
perfectly adjusted to each other. The statements and illustrations convey
the thought clearly and aptly."&mdash;<i>Boston Watchman.</i></p>

<p>"You have made an exceedingly valuable contribution to the science of
political economy. I am not a little surprised that a college professor
should have written a book so intelligible to the common mind, and so
eminently practical and instructive. Accept my thanks for your kindness
in sending me the book, and my grateful acknowledgments as your fellow-citizen
for the service you have rendered the country. It is, in my judgment,
the ablest and most valuable work yet published upon the science of which
it treats. I do not see where it could be improved in matter, or style, or
arrangement."&mdash;<i>Hon. H. McCullough, Secretary of the U. S. Treasury.</i></p>

<p>"Your book interests students more than any I have ever instructed
from."&mdash;<i>President T. D. Woolsey, Yale College.</i></p>

<p>"So far as I have been able to read it, it seems to my humble judgment
remarkably clear, as well as well-timed and sound."&mdash;<i>Hon. W. E. Forster, M.P., Leeds, Eng.</i></p>

<p>"The gem of your work is 'foreign trade.' It is the best thing I have
ever seen, the most clear and satisfactory. If my friend Cobden were
alive, he would send you his congratulations and thanks."&mdash;<i>Hon. Amasa
Walker, M.C., Lecturer on Political Economy, Amherst College.</i></p>

<p>"As a manual for general reading and popular instruction, Prof. Perry's
book is far superior to any work on this subject before issued in the United
States."&mdash;<i>New York Times.</i></p>

<p>"We cordially recommend this book to all, of whatever school of political
economy, who enjoy candid statement and full and logical discussion."&mdash;<i>New York Nation.</i></p>

<p>"There is more common sense in this book than in any of the more
elaborate works on the same subject that have preceded it. It is the most
interesting and valuable one that has been given to the American public on
this important subject."&mdash;<i>New York Independent.</i></p>

<p>"In all the portions of the book which we have read the author shows
himself to be a clear, strong, bold, and generally sound thinker."&mdash;<i>New Englander.</i></p>

<p>"Prof. Perry has certainly produced one of the best elementary treatises
on political economy that we have ever met with in any language."&mdash;<i>New York Commercial.</i></p>

<p>"Prof. Perry is a vigorous thinker, a clear and forcible writer."&mdash;<i>Princeton Review.</i></p></blockquote>
